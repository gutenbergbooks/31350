PREFACE
</H3>

<P>
The book of Acts shows in a very graphic way the rapid growth and
marvelous progress of Christianity in the midst of great opposition.
We see in process of fulfillment the promise of Jesus Christ to his
disciples that they should receive power after the Holy Ghost had come
upon them and that they should be witnesses unto Him "both in Jerusalem
and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the
earth."  Those were earnest times and full of stirring events, when men
went forth to conquer a hostile world not with swords, but by the
preaching of a gospel of peace and good will.  As soon as this
proclamation was made in Judea and Samaria a new instrument was chosen
by Jesus Christ, in Paul, to carry His message to the uttermost part of
the earth.  He thus became at once the chief character in the larger
work of planting and developing churches outside of Palestine.  The
study of Paul's life shows the difficulties encountered, the doctrines
taught, and the organization perfected in the early churches.  "We here
watch the dawn of the gospel which the Savior preached as it broadens
gradually into the boundless day."
</P>

<P>
Bible Studies in the Life of Paul is designed to follow the author's
Bible Studies in the Life of Christ and to show the work of the Great
Apostle in carrying the gospel to a Gentile world.  The aim is to
present the work of Paul in a constructive and historical way.  While
there has been a careful consideration, on the part of the author, of
disputed questions, only conclusions upon which there is a general
agreement amongst scholars, and which can be consistently held, are
presented.  The great main facts of Paul's life and work stand forth
unchallenged and the emphasis is placed upon them.  This book is
divided into three parts, Paul's preparation for his work, his
missionary journeys, and his writings.  This is a text book, and, with
the analysis of each study and questions, is prepared for the use of
normal and advanced Sunday-school classes, teachers' meetings, schools,
colleges, and private study.  This is the sixth book of the kind which
the author has prepared and sent forth.  The large favor with which the
other books have been received, and the desire, first of all, of making
the life and work of Paul even better known, have been the motives
which have led to its preparation.

EARLY LIFE
</H4>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE PLACE OF PAUL
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Man, Paul,</B> judged by the influence he has exerted in the world,
is one of the greatest characters in all history.  He is pre-eminent
not only as a missionary, but as a marvelous thinker and writer.  "He
was a personality of vast power, force, and individuality."  There are
some men who seem to be born and prepared to do a large work for the
world; Paul makes the impression upon those who carefully read the
record of his life that he stands first in this class of men.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Work of the Apostle.</B>&mdash;As John the Baptist preceded Christ and
prepared the way for His coming, so Paul succeeded Christ and went
throughout the heathen world proclaiming that the Christ had come, and
calling upon all men, Jews and Gentiles, to repent and accept Him as
their Lord and Savior.  So wide was his work as a missionary of the
cross, and an interpreter of the Christ, that a certain class of
critics have sought to make him the creator of Christianity, as we know
it; a position which Paul would be the first to repudiate.  He sought
of himself, before he was apprehended by Christ on the way to Damascus,
to drive Christianity from the face of the earth.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Leading Thought</B> in Paul's mind, after his conversion, was
personal devotion to Christ; this was the mainspring of every act.  He
said, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but
Christ liveth in me": (Gal. 2:20).  "For me to live is Christ" (Phil.
1:21).  In his letters to the churches which he founded, there are
found no picturesque descriptions of cities or of scenery; his one
thought is to make known the Christ.  He says, writing to the
Corinthian church, "and I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with
excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of
God.  For I determined not to know anything among you, save Jesus
Christ and Him crucified" (1 Cor. 2:1, 2).  In the evangelization of
the heathen world, for which task he had been set apart by the Holy
Spirit (Acts 13:2) and which he had accepted with all his heart, it is
not only his leading, but his only thought to make known Jesus Christ
as Lord and Savior.
</P>

<P>
To miss this supreme purpose of Paul in the study of his life is to
miss its whole significance (Phil. 2:1-11; Col. 1:12-20).
</P>

<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
BIRTH
</H4>

<P>
<B>Place.</B>&mdash;The world is interested in the birthplaces of its great men.
Some of these birthplaces are in doubt.  There is no doubt about the
place in which Paul was born.  He says, in making a speech to the Jews,
"I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia"
(Acts 22:3).  This city was the capital of Cilicia and was situated in
the southeastern part of Asia Minor.  It was but a few miles from the
coast and was easily accessible from the Mediterranean sea by a
navigable river.  A large commerce was controlled by the merchants, on
sea and on land.  Tarsus, while one of three university centers of the
period, ranking with Athens and Alexandria, was an exceedingly corrupt
city.  It was the chief seat of "a special Baal worship of an imposing
but unspeakably degrading character."
</P>

<P>
<B>Time.</B>&mdash;The date of Paul's birth is nowhere recorded, but from certain
dates given in the Acts, from which we reckon back, it is thought that
he was born about the same time as Jesus Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>Family.</B>&mdash;We are left, in this matter, without any uncertainty.  Paul
says, "I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee" (Acts 23:6).  I was
"circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of
Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Pharisee"
(Phil. 3:5).  Paul's father and mother were Jews of the stricter sort.
The expression which Paul uses, "An Hebrew of the Hebrews" is very
significant.  The Jews of the Dispersion were known at this time as
Hebrews and Hellenists.  The Hebrews clung to the Hebrew tongue and
followed Hebrew customs.  The Hellenists spoke Greek by preference and
adopted, more or less, Greek views and civilization.  Paul had a
married sister who lived in Jerusalem (Acts 23:16) and relatives in
Rome (Rom. 16:7, 11).
</P>

<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
TRAINING
</H4>

<P>
<B>Home.</B>&mdash;The instruction received in the home has often more influence
and is more lasting than any other.  Paul received the usual thorough
training of the Jew boy accentuated in his case, in all probability, by
the open iniquity which was daily practised in his native city.  We
never hear him expressing any regret that he received such thorough
religious instruction at the hands of his parents.
</P>

<P>
<B>Mental, Moral, and Religious.</B>&mdash;Good teachers were employed to
instruct the boy, who was afterwards to make such a mark in the world.
After going through the school, under the care of the synagogue at
Tarsus, he was sent to Jerusalem to complete his education.  Paul,
speaking in this chief Jewish city, says, I was "brought up in this
city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect
manner of the law of the fathers" (Acts 22:3).  It is very evident that
He had a profound knowledge of the Scriptures from the large use he
makes of them in his Epistles.  He seems also to have been quite well
acquainted with Greek philosophy and literature.  He quotes from the
Greek poets, Aratus, Epimenides, and Menander.  No man ever studied men
and the motives which actuate them more than he.  His inward life was
pure (Acts 23:1; 24:16).  Paul differed from Christ in that he was a
man who sought the cities and drew his illustrations from them, while
Christ was much in the country and drew his illustrations from country
life.  But in this study of and work for the city Paul was but carrying
out the commands of Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>Industrial.</B>&mdash;It was required of every Jew father that his boy should
learn some trade by which he might support himself should necessity
require it.  It was a common Jewish proverb that "he who taught his son
no trade taught him to be a thief."  Paul was taught the trade of tent
making.  "The hair of the Cicilian goats was used to make a cloth which
was especially adapted for tents for travelers, merchants, and
soldiers."  He afterwards found this trade very useful in his
missionary work (Acts 18:3; 20:34; 1 Cor. 4:12; 1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess.
3:8).
</P>

<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE WORLD AS PAUL SAW IT
</H4>

<P>
<B>This World</B> was very different from the world as we see it to-day.
This makes it difficult for us to appreciate his work at its full
value.  Now, Christianity is the great religion of the world; then it
was unknown, outside a very limited circle of believers.  The state and
society were organized upon a different basis and were in strong
opposition to the new religion.
</P>

<P>
<B>Political.</B>&mdash;The world was under the dominion of the Romans.  They, in
conquering it, broke down the barriers that had separated tribe from
tribe and nation from nation.  Yet it was a comparatively small world
for all interests centered about the Mediterranean Sea.  Before the
Romans the Greeks had been in possession of a part of this world and
had permeated and penetrated the whole of it, with their art, language,
and commerce.  With the upheavals of war and the tribulations that had
befallen the Jews, they were everywhere scattered abroad and had their
synagogues in most of the cities.
</P>

<P>
<B>Religious.</B>&mdash;For the Romans, Greeks, and conquered nations and tribes,
it was an age of scepticism.  While the gods and goddesses in the great
heathen temples still had their rites and ceremonies observed yet the
people, to a large degree, had ceased to believe in them.  The Roman
writers of the period are agreed in the slackening of religious ties
and of moral restraints.  Yet it was the policy of the state to
maintain the worship of the gods and goddesses.  Any attack upon them
or their worship was regarded as an offense against the state.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Difficulties</B> of the situation were threefold: (a) To seek to
overturn the religion of the state constituted an offense which was
punishable by stripes and imprisonment; (b) To rebuke men's sins and
the evils of the times stirred up bitter opposition on their part; (c)
To proclaim a crucified and risen Christ as the Messiah to the Jews,
when they expected a great conquering hero, often excited and put them
in a rage.
</P>

<P>
That Paul could preach Christ and establish churches, under all the
opposition that he encountered, shows how fully and implicitly he
believed in his Lord.
</P>

<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
QUESTIONS
</H4>

<P>
What impression has the man, Paul, made upon the world?  What was his
work as an apostle?  What his leading thought?  Where is the place of
his birth?  What can be said of his family?  How was he educated and
trained, in the home, in school, and for a trade?  What was the
political and religious condition of the world as Paul saw it?  What
were the three difficulties in the way of his work in preaching Christ?

PAUL, THE PERSECUTOR
</H4>

<P>
<B>Order of Events.</B>&mdash;It seems to be quite evident, when Paul finished
his studies in Jerusalem, that he left the city and engaged in work
somewhere else, during the years when John the Baptist and Jesus were
preaching and teaching.  In all probability he did not return until
after the crucifixion and resurrection of Christ.
</P>

<P>
Paul first appears in the narrative of the Acts, under the name of
Saul, at the martyrdom of Stephen, where he takes charge of the clothes
of the witnesses (Acts 7:58, 59).
</P>

<P>
From the Ascension of Christ to the martyrdom of Stephen is an
important period in the history of the infant church.  On and after the
day of Pentecost (Acts 2) the apostles and followers of the risen Lord
assumed a very bold attitude.  They did not hesitate to speak openly in
the temple (Acts 3:12-16) of the crime of putting "The Prince of Life"
to death and asserted that He was risen from the dead.  The priests and
Sadducees strongly objected to this kind of preaching (Acts 4), laid
hands upon the preachers, and put them in prison.  When they were
examined the next day before (Acts 4:5-13) the Jewish tribunal, the
apostles spoke even more boldly of Jesus and his resurrection and
refused to be silenced (Acts 4:13-20, 33).  Again an attempt was made
to stop the preaching of the apostles, but they refused to keep still
(Acts 5:16-33).  A remarkable prison deliverance by the "Angel of the
Lord" (Acts 5:19, 20) gave them great courage in proclaiming "all the
words of this life."
</P>

<P>
At this point Gamaliel (Acts 5:34-42) proposes in the Jewish council a
new policy, which was to let the followers of Christ alone, arguing
that then they would speedily give up their preaching.  This policy was
adopted (Acts 5:40).  But with the election of Stephen as a deacon
(Acts 6:1-8) the followers of Christ began to multiply with great
rapidity and it was soon seen that "the let-alone policy" was a mistake
(Acts 6:9-15).  Persecution again breaks out which results in the death
of Stephen (Acts 7), the bringing out of Saul as the arch persecutor,
and the scattering of the church (Acts 8:1-4).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Inevitable Conflict.</B>&mdash;Had the early Christians been content to
have proclaimed Jesus Christ to be but a great teacher and prophet,
they would in all probability have become a Jewish sect and been
speedily lost to sight.  But extraordinary claims were put forth that
Jesus Christ was the promised Messiah (Acts 2:25-40), the Son of God
(Acts 3:26), the Forgiver of sins (Acts 2:38; 5:31), that He was risen
from the dead (Acts 4:33), that obedience to Him was above that to the
Jewish rulers (Acts 4:18-20), that the Jews had wickedly slain Christ
(Acts 3:14, 15), and that salvation was only through Him (Acts 4:12).
Further than this they wrought miracles in the name of Jesus Christ
(Acts 3:2-8, 16; 2:43; 5:12).
</P>

<P>
It was very soon plainly seen that Christianity could keep no truce,
and proposed to keep no truce, which called in question or denied the
supremacy of Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Cruelty of the Persecutor.</B>&mdash;To a man of Paul's temperament and
zeal there could be no half way measures in a case like this.  He could
not be content to bide his time.  Either the claims of Christ were true
or false.  If false, then they were doing harm and His doctrine and
teaching must be eradicated at any cost.  All the aggressive forces of
the Jews found a champion in this Saul of Tarsus.  Drastic measures
were at once inaugurated.  There was to be no more temporizing.  The
cruelty and thoroughness of the persecutor, in his work, are shown in
his instituting a house to house canvass seeking for the Christians and
sparing neither age nor sex (Acts 8:1, 3).
</P>

<P>
In the first persecutions the Jews had been content to arrest and
imprison those who publicly preached Christ, but now the policy was
changed and Christianity was to be exterminated root and branch.  All
believers in Christ were to be hunted out.
</P>

<P>
The character of Saul, the arch persecutor, is shown in the
characterization of him by Luke, when he represented him as breathing
out, "threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord"
(Acts 9:1).
</P>

<BR><BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
CONVERSION
</H4>

<P>
<B>Cause.</B>&mdash;The book of the Acts, opened at one place, shows a fierce
hater and persecutor of the Christians (8:3), opened at another place
it shows this same persecutor as an ardent and enthusiastic preacher of
the faith in Jesus Christ (13:16-39)  We seek for the cause of this
remarkable change.  Luke tells us that Saul was on his way to Damascus,
seeking victims for his persecuting zeal, when Jesus suddenly appeared
to him and Saul was changed from a persecutor to a believer in Christ
(Acts 9:3-7).  The account is very brief.  For an event which has had
such tremendous results, the narrator is very reticent; a light from
heaven, a voice speaking, and a person declaring that He is Jesus.
Paul gives us two accounts of his conversion and how it took place
(Acts 22:6-15; 26:12-18).  The men who were with Paul saw a light and
heard a voice, but not what was said.  It is impossible to describe or
exaggerate what took place in Paul's mind in those brief moments while
Jesus talked to him; but his beliefs, and his whole life plan were
radically changed.  It had been well if no explanation of this
conversion had been attempted and the great fact had been left to stand
as it does in the Acts.  Attempts, however, have been made to minimize
the power of this conversion and the marvelous and sudden change it
wrought in the character and life of Paul.  Some critics seeking a
natural, rather than a supernatural, cause have attributed to Paul
certain compunctions of conscience and misgivings about his persecution
of the Christians, together with a hot day and a certain temperament,
which led him to have a subjective experience, which he thought was
real.  But there is no recorded evidence forthcoming that Paul ever had
any compunctions of conscience about persecuting the Christians.  Paul
was an honest man to the very core of his being; in the two accounts he
gives us of this conversion, and in incidental references to it, he
never even hints at any such state of mind.  The expression used by
Jesus, "It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks" (Acts 9-5), of
which so much has been made, means no more than that Saul's opposition
and hard work against the Christians (Acts 8:3; 9:1), would be of no
avail.  In doing what he did Paul thought he was doing God's service.
Again the language which Paul uses and the references which he makes to
this appearance of Christ forbid us to think that it was only a mere
vision of Christ which he saw.  "He ranks it as the last of the
appearances of the risen Savior to His disciples and places it on the
same level as the appearances to Peter, to James, to the eleven, and to
the five hundred" (1 Cor. 15:1-8).  In these appearances Jesus had
eaten with his disciples and been touched by them (John 20:24-31; Luke
24:36-43), appearing as a real being, according to the narrative.
</P>

<P>
"It was the appearance to Paul of the risen Lord, which made him a
Christian, gave him a gospel to preach, and sent him forth as the
apostle of the Gentiles."
</P>

<P>
The time of Paul's conversion was about 36 A.D.
</P>

<P>
<B>Effects.</B>&mdash;There is no question as to the very marked results which
followed the appearance of the risen Lord to Saul on the way to
Damascus.
</P>

<P>
1.  Physical.  He was smitten with blindness (Acts 9:8), and was
without food for three days (Acts 9:9).  His sight was restored by
Ananias at the command of the Lord (Acts 9:15-18).
</P>

<P>
2.  Mental and spiritual.  His whole outlook upon life and its
significance was changed.  He received baptism and was filled with the
Holy Spirit (Acts 9:17).  From being a persecutor he became an
enthusiastic witness for Christ (Acts 9:20-22).
</P>

<P>
3.  Penalty.  The consequences of his former course of action were
visited upon him; for the Jews sought to kill him and the disciples of
Christ were at first afraid of him (Acts 9:23-26).  But Barnabas
vouched for his sincerity (Acts 9:27).
</P>

<P>
4.  The relief to the Christians at Damascus, when Saul was converted,
was very great.  They had looked forward to his coming with dread.
</P>

<P>
5.  The triumph of Christ.  In Paul Christianity won its most efficient
missionary and, next to Christ, its greatest thinker, preacher, and
teacher.
</P>

<P>
6.  The estimates of the results of this conversion of Saul cannot be
too large; they are world wide.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
PERIOD OF WAITING
</H4>

<P>
<B>Retirement of Paul.</B>&mdash;From the conversion of Paul (Acts 9:3-7) to his
call to the missionary work (Acts 13:2) is a period of about ten years.
During this time we have only incidental notices of him and what he was
doing.  When we think of it there is nothing strange in this
retirement.  It is the divine method, as in the case of Moses, when a
man is to do a very large work for God that he should be well prepared
for it.  The chief scripture notices of this period of retirement are
found in Acts 9:19-30; Gal. 1:15-24; (Acts 11:25-30; 12:25).  From
these notices it is quite plain: (a) That Paul retired into Arabia.
(b) That he preached in Damascus and Jerusalem, but was compelled to
flee from both cities on account of the persecutions of the Jews, who
sought his life.  (c) That he went to Tarsus and "into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia."  (d) That he came to Antioch, where there was a
great revival (Acts 11:25-30), at the solicitation of Barnabas.  Luke
in his account (Acts 9:19-30) does not mention the trip to Arabia
spoken of by Paul in his epistle to the Galatians (1:15-24).  It must
be remembered however that each is writing from a different point of
view.  Luke is a historian recording only the most salient facts and
passing over the mention of many events.  We see this in the
compression in eight and a half short chapters of the events of the
three missionary journeys.  Paul writing to the Galatians is anxious to
establish the fact that he received his commission, as an apostle, not
from man, but from Christ himself (Gal. 1:1); hence he enters more into
details and we get from him the inside view.  The accounts of Luke and
Paul if read carefully, keeping in mind all the circumstances, are seen
not to be in any way antagonistic, but to supplement each other.
</P>

<P>
<B>Reasons.</B>&mdash;Many reasons have been given for the retirement of Paul to
Arabia, and what seems to be the period of comparative inactivity that
followed it.
</P>

<P>
1.  Fierce opposition on the part of the Jews whenever Paul attempted
to preach, as in the cities of Damascus and Jerusalem.
</P>

<P>
2.  A preparation of mind and heart for his great work.  As a thinker
he needed to look upon all sides of the gospel, which he was afterwards
to preach so effectively to the Gentiles.
</P>

<P>
3.  A careful rereading of the Old Testament.  As a Jew he had read the
Scriptures in one way, now he reread them seeing Christ there.
</P>

<P>
4.  System of doctrine.  He may at this time have wrought out that
magnificent system of Christian doctrine which he afterwards presented
to the churches in his Epistles.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Gospel for the Gentiles.</B>&mdash;While Paul was waiting for the call to
his great missionary work there came a new crisis in the history of the
early church, and a new era was inaugurated.  In the tenth and eleventh
chapters of the book of Acts Luke tells us of the conversion of the
Gentile Cornelius, "a centurion of the band called the Italian band"
(Acts 10:1-8), and of the instructions given to Peter to receive him
(Acts 10:9-44).
</P>

<P>
Cornelius was the first Gentile convert and we note here the beginning
of the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, which was to have such
large results.  "The day of Pentecost, the conversion of Saul of
Tarsus, the call of Cornelius and the foundation of the Gentile church
at Antioch are, if we are to pick and choose amid the events related by
Luke, the turning points of the earliest ecclesiastical history."  How
great and epoch making was this new departure of preaching the gospel
to the Gentiles, and receiving them into the church, is shown in the
eleventh chapter of the Acts (11:1-18) where, when Peter goes up to
Jerusalem, he is put on the defensive and compelled to explain why he
received Cornelius into the church.  When however the matter was fully
explained the early disciples rejoiced over the fact that to the
Gentiles was granted by God repentance unto life (Acts 11:18).
</P>

<P>
<B>Paul Brought to Antioch</B> by Barnabas, on account of the revival that
had broken out in that city, is another step which he takes up to his
work as the great missionary to the Gentiles (Acts 11:25-26).  It was
here that the disciples were first called Christians (Acts 11:26).  It
was from this city that Paul went forth on his missionary journeys and
it was here that he returned (Acts 13:1-3; 14:26; 15:24-41; 18:22;
18:23).
</P>

<P>
"Antioch was the capital of the Greek kingdom of Syria, and afterwards
the residence of the Roman governor of the province.  It was made a
free city by Pompey the Great, and contained an aqueduct, amphitheater,
baths, and colonnades.  It was situated on the Orontes about twenty
miles from the mouth of the river.  Its sea-port was Seleucia.  It was
intimately connected with apostolic Christianity.  Here the first
Gentile church was formed" (Acts 11:20, 21).

<H4 ALIGN="center">
QUESTIONS
</H4>

<P>
Give the order of events which led to the persecution in which Paul was
so prominent.  Why was the conflict between Christianity and Judaism
inevitable?  What can be said of the cruelty of Paul, the persecutor?
Give the cause of Paul's conversion.  What were some of the effects?
What can be said of the period of waiting; the retirement of Paul?
What are some of the probable reasons for this retirement?  What can be
said about the beginning of the gospel to the Gentiles?  By whom was
Paul brought to Antioch and for what purpose?  In what relation does
Antioch stand to the missionary journeys of Paul?

<H4 ALIGN="center">
INTRODUCTION TO THE THREE MISSIONARY JOURNEYS
</H4>

<P>
Before taking up the study of the first missionary journey, attention
is called to certain points which should be considered in regard to all
three of them (Acts 13:1-21:17).
</P>

<P>
We have now arrived at what we might call the watershed of the Acts of
the Apostles.  Hitherto we have had various scenes, characters,
personages to consider.  Henceforth Paul, his labors, his disputes, his
speeches, occupy the entire field, and every other man who is
introduced into the narrative plays a subordinate part.
</P>

<P>
Our attention is now turned from the Jewish world, considered so
largely in the first twelve chapters of the Acts, to the heathen world
and the struggle which Paul and his fellow laborers had with it, in
bringing it to Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Call</B> to this work was by the Holy Ghost in the city of Antioch
(Acts 13:1-4).  Luke says, "As they ministered to the Lord and fasted,
the Holy Ghost said, separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work
whereunto I have called them" (Acts 13:2, 4).  Contrast this with the
beginning of the work in Jerusalem which was also inaugurated by the
Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:14; 2:1-4).  This call was
in accordance with what Jesus had told his disciples before His
ascension (Acts 1:8).
</P>

<P>
The agency of the Holy Ghost in directing and promoting this missionary
work is very manifest (Acts 13:2, 4, 9, 52; 15:8, 28; 16:6; 19:2, 6;
20:23, 28; 21:11; 28:25).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Significance</B> and importance of these journeys cannot be
overestimated.  It is probable, when the call came, that Paul had but
little idea of their magnitude and that in the end they would result in
changing not only the religion, but the philosophy and civilization of
the world.
</P>

<P>
<B>Extent and Time.</B>&mdash;It is estimated that the first journey was 1,400
miles long, the second 3,200, and the third 3,500, making 8,100 miles
traveled by Paul.  The time occupied for the three journeys was about
ten years.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Record</B> of the three missionary journeys, is briefly comprised in
eight and a half chapters (Acts 13:1-21:17), and it does not profess to
be a complete one.  Only the most striking incidents and events, and
probably not all of these, are given.  There were side trips not
recorded by Luke; Paul speaks of one to Illyricum (Rom. 15:19), and of
others in which he underwent great perils (2 Cor. 11:24-27).
</P>

<P>
The purpose of Luke seems to be to show how, in accordance with the
command and promise of Christ, the knowledge and power of the gospel
was spread, beginning in Jerusalem, through Judea, and Samaria,
throughout the heathen world (Acts 1:8); everything seems to be made to
bend to this purpose.  Certainly there could be no more graphic and
concise account of these epoch making events than that given us by this
wonderful narrator.
</P>

<P>
<B>Other Long Journeys.</B>&mdash;1.  Paul's voyage to Rome as a prisoner.  Luke
gives a full account of this voyage, its many interesting incidents
(Acts 27:1-28:16), and of the circumstances which led up to it (Acts
21:17-27:1).
</P>

<P>
2.  There is every reason to believe that Paul was released at the end
of his two years imprisonment in Rome (Acts 28:30) and that he made an
Eastern journey as far as Colossæ and a Western journey as far as Spain.
</P>

<P>
NOTE.&mdash;These last journeys are considered in chapter ten.
</P>

<P>
<B>Method of Work and Support.</B>&mdash;Paul and his companion, or company, when
they entered into a city would first seek for a lodging and then for
work, going from one tent maker's door to another until finally a place
was found.  Then upon the following Sabbath they would seek the Jewish
synagogue and after the reading of the Scriptures, when an opportunity
was given, Paul would arise and begin to speak, (Acts 13:14-16) leading
up through the Old Testament message (Acts 13:17-43) to the great topic
of Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah and closing with an exhortation
to believe on Him.  Such a speech would naturally excite great interest
coming from the lips of one, who by his speech and the handling of the
Old Testament, would be recognized as a cultivated Jewish Rabbi.  Paul
would be asked to speak again the next Sabbath (Acts 13:44-52), the
synagogue would be full of people and he would set forth Jesus Christ
more plainly as the Savior both of Jew and Gentile.  This would
generally be a signal for the Jews to contradict and oppose Paul, but
some Jews would believe with a number of Gentiles.  This would be the
starting point of the Christian church in that community.  The Jews,
however, who were untouched by what Paul preached, and who looked upon
him as the destroyer of their religion, would raise a cry against him
and seek to have him expelled from the city.  This experience was
frequently repeated.  There were great difficulties also to be
encountered when the heathen thought that their worship was in danger
(Acts 19:20-30).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Message</B> which Paul bore to Jew and Gentile was the moving force
of all his work.  The starting point was the memorable day when Jesus
Christ appeared to him on his way to Damascus.  Paul believed that he
received his commission as an apostle directly from Jesus Christ (Gal.
1:1-24).  The four main positions of Paul, set forth so plainly in his
Epistle to the Romans, are: (a) All are guilty before God (Jew and
Gentile).  (b) All need a Savior.  (c) Christ died for all.  (d) We are
all (through faith) one body in Christ.  Paul leaves us in no doubt as
to how he regards Jesus Christ.  He is to him the Son of God, through
whom God created all things and who is the Divine Savior of man (Eph.
3:9-21; Phil. 2:9-11; Rom. 9:5).  There is no doubt, no hesitation on
Paul's part in delivering his message.  He is a witness, testifying to
the glory of his Divine Lord.  He is a messenger who cannot alter or
tamper with that which has been entrusted to him.  To the rude
inhabitants of the mountain regions of Asia Minor, to the philosophers
in Athens, to the Roman governors in Cæsarea, to the dwellers in
Corinth and in Rome the purport of the Message is always the same.

THE FIRST JOURNEY
</H4>

<H5 ALIGN="center">
<I>Scripture, Acts 13:1-14:28</I>
</H5>

<P>
<B>Preparation.</B>&mdash;First, on the part of Paul.  About ten years have
passed since his conversion.  During this time we have few notices of
him, but he was undoubtedly making ready for this very important work
of a missionary.  Second, on the part of the church.  The first step
had already been taken, in the conversion of Cornelius, in the giving
of the gospel to the Gentile world.  Third, Paul was brought to Antioch
by Barnabas to assist the church in the great revival which broke out
in that second early center of Christian work and teaching (Acts
11:21-26).  Fourth, the large success of the disciples who went
throughout Judea and Samaria, preaching the gospel, after the death of
Stephen (Acts 7:5-8:4; 11:19-21) made possible this new aggressive
movement to the regions beyond.  Fifth, the Christian prophets and
teachers at Antioch "ministered to the Lord and fasted."  They desired
to know the will of the Lord and it was made known to them by the Holy
Ghost.  "And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on
them, they sent them away."  "So they being sent forth by the Holy
Ghost, departed unto Seleucia (Acts 13:3, 4).
</P>

<P>
<B>Companions of the Journey</B>, Barnabas and Saul (Acts 13:2) and John
Mark (Acts 13:5).  Barnabas has been called the discoverer of Saul.  He
was probably a convert of the day of Pentecost.  He was a land
proprietor of the island of Cyprus and early showed his zeal for Christ
by selling his land and devoting the proceeds to the cause in which he
so heartily believed (Acts 4:36, 37).  He early sought out and
manifested, in a very practical way, his friendship for Paul (Acts
9:27; 11:22, 25, 30; 12:25).  John Mark, who started on this journey
with Barnabas and Saul, was a nephew of Barnabas (Acts 13:5, 13; 12:25;
Col. 4:10).
</P>

<P>
<B>Paul Comes to the Front</B> when his company leave Paphos and ever after
he has the first place (Acts 13: 13).  Here also he is called Paul for
the first time, a name which he retains.
</P>

<P>
<B>Extent and Time</B>&mdash;This was the shortest of the three journeys (about
1,400 miles).  It extended over the island of Cyprus and a part of Asia
Minor.  In time it occupied about three years, 47-50 A.D.
</P>

<P>
<B>Rulers</B>&mdash;Claudius was the emperor of Rome, since 41 A.D.  Herod
Agrippa was king of Chalcis, Ananias was high priest in Jerusalem.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE ITINERARY
</H4>

<P>
NOTE.&mdash;The cities, which Paul visited in this and the other journeys,
should be located upon the map by the student.  It will greatly
increase the interest to consult some good Bible dictionary and get
well acquainted also with the history of the places.
</P>

<P>
</P>

<P>
<B>Salamis</B>, on the island of Cyprus, was the first place reached, after
sailing from Seleucia (Acts 13:4, 5) the sea-port of Antioch.  It was
the natural thing to go first to this island as it had been the home of
Barnabas and many Jews had settled there; it was about eighty miles to
the southwest of Seleucia.
</P>

<P>
<B>Paphos.</B>&mdash;After passing through the island from east to west the
missionaries came to Paphos.  This city was the seat of the worship of
Venus, the goddess of love.  This worship was carried on with the most
degrading of immoralities.
</P>

<P>
The chief incidents in the ministry here were the smiting of the Jewish
sorcerer, Elymas, with blindness for his persistent opposition and the
conversion of the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus (Acts 13:6-12).
Saul is filled with an unusual power of the Spirit for his work in this
city and takes the name of Paul.  It is now no longer Barnabas and
Saul, but Paul and Barnabas.
</P>

<P>
<B>Perga in Pamphylia</B>&mdash;(Acts 13:13, 14).  The missionaries take ship
from Paphos and sail in a north-easterly direction across the
Mediterranean Sea to this city of Asia Minor.  John Mark, doubtless
appalled by the difficulties which had already been experienced and now
that the journey seemed to promise still greater hardships, left the
company and returned to Jerusalem.
</P>

<P>
<B>Antioch in Pisidia</B> (Acts 13:14-52) was about ninety miles directly
north of Perga.  It was a good-sized city with a large Jewish
population.  Luke's account of this visit is notable in that we have
the chief points in Paul's speech in the synagogue set down.  This
address is worth study from the fact that it is the first sermon of
Paul of which we have any record, and is probably the usual way in
which he began his work in a great many Jewish synagogues.  Paul is
asked to speak to the assembled Jews.  He begins upon the common ground
of the history of Israel.  He declares the promise of a Savior.  This
Savior is to be of the seed of David.  Then Paul sets forth that Jesus
is the promised Savior.  He reminds them of the testimony of John and
of those who had seen Jesus before and after His resurrection.  He
declares unto them the glad tidings of a Savior.  He warns them of
their peril in rejecting Jesus Christ.  Paul is invited to speak upon
the next Sabbath, but there is a division and those who oppose Paul try
to drive him out of their city which they finally succeed in doing.
But the Word has fallen into good soil and there is the beginning of a
Christian church.
</P>

<P>
<B>Iconium in Lycaonia</B> (Acts 14:1-5) is over one hundred miles distant
from Antioch.  The missionaries were now in a country of a people with
strange ways.  They remained here for some time and their ministry was
attested by "signs and wonders."  But again some of the Jews opposed
them and stirred up the multitude.  A plan was made by the ringleaders
of the opposition to stone them, but being made aware of it Paul and
Barnabas "fled unto Derbe and Lystra."  They had, however, the
satisfaction of leaving behind "a great multitude of believing Jews and
Greeks" (Acts 14:1).
</P>

<P>
<B>Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia</B> (Acts 14:6-21).&mdash;"And there they
preached the gospel."  There is no mention of any Jewish synagogue at
either of these cities.  The inhabitants were worshippers of the
heathen gods.  The healing of a lame man at Lystra brought Paul and
Barnabas directly into touch with the heathen priests and populace.
When they saw this miracle of healing, they thought that the gods had
come down to earth in the likeness of men.  Barnabas was called Jupiter
"and Paul Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker."  When Paul and
Barnabas sought to restrain the priests and people from doing sacrifice
to them, it is interesting to note what words Paul uses in addressing
them.  As with the Jews he here seeks first of all a common ground.  He
says, "We are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that
you should turn from these vanities unto the living God, which made
heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein; who in
times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
Nevertheless He left not Himself without a witness, in that He did
good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our
hearts with food and gladness" (Acts 14:15-17).  We find the same
earnestness the same desire to preach the gospel to the heathen here as
to the Jews elsewhere.  But the Jews who had made trouble in Antioch
and Iconium for the missionaries came to Lystra and, forming a plot
against Paul, persuaded the people and stoned him so that he was drawn
out of the city, they "supposing he had been dead."  But he was not
dead, he soon rose up and came back into the city and the next day
departed with Barnabas to Derbe, where they preached the gospel and
taught many.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Return Journey</B> is very briefly recorded (Acts 14:21-28).  The
missionaries returned through the same cities, Lystra, Iconium,
Antioch, and so back to Perga.  But from the last city they did not
sail to the island of Cyprus, but took a different course, westerly
along the coast to Attalia in Pamphylia and from thence they sailed to
Antioch, the starting point of their trip.  During this return journey
they proved to their friends and enemies that, in departing from the
cities where mobs threatened them, it was through no cowardice on their
part, but for other reasons and for the purpose of preaching the gospel
in the regions beyond.  They "confirmed the souls of the disciples
exhorting them to continue in the faith."  They also further perfected
the organization of the churches, ordaining elders in every church.
They prayed with and for the disciples and commended them to the Lord.
</P>

<P>
When the missionaries at last entered the city of Antioch, "they
rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how He had opened the
door of faith unto the Gentiles."  There must have been great rejoicing
over this happy return of Paul and Barnabas.

THE JERUSALEM COUNCIL
</H4>

<H5 ALIGN="center">
<I>Acts 15:1-35</I>
</H5>

<P>
<B>One Problem of the Early Church</B> was how to reconcile the commandments
of Moses with the new law of liberty in Jesus Christ.  Ought the
Gentile Christians to observe the law of Moses?  Ought they to become
Jews before they became Christians?  Were there to be two churches?
One for Jewish and another for Gentile Christians?  These questions are
obsolete now, but then they were burning ones and hotly debated.  Hence
this Jerusalem Council, where the matter was debated and settled, was
exceedingly important and fraught with great and grave consequences for
the future welfare of the church.  Because certain of the Jewish
brethren came to Antioch and began to teach that it was necessary to
salvation that a certain Jewish ordinance and the law of Moses be kept,
it was determined to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem.
</P>

<P>
A council of "the apostles and elders came together for to consider of
this matter" (Acts 15:6).  At this council in Jerusalem, Peter, Paul,
Barnabas, and James were the chief speakers.  All matters were
carefully gone over.  Of all the speeches made, Luke records only the
two made by Peter (Acts 15:7-12) and James (Acts 15:13-2l), which must
have embodied the sense of the meeting in that both spoke for liberty,
from the Mosaic yoke, in Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Decision</B> of the council was for the freedom of the Gentile
Christians and that they should not be obliged to become Jews before
they became Christians.  Thus was one of the grave crises of the early
church safely passed.  Paul and Barnabas went back happy in that great
victory for Gentile Christianity to their brethren at Antioch.
</P>

<P>
It should be borne in mind, however, that while the question of the
relation of the Gentile Christians to the law of Moses was decided at
this council, it was one which came up again and again to hamper and
bother Paul in his missionary work.

SECOND MISSIONARY JOURNEY
</H4>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
<I>Scripture, Acts 15:36-18:22</I>
</H4>

<BR>

<P>
<B>The Inception</B>&mdash;After the Jerusalem Council Paul returned to Antioch
where he spent some time, "teaching and preaching the Word of the Lord
with many others also."  "And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas,
Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have
preached the Word of the Lord, and see how they do" (Acts 15:35, 36).
He felt that he must be advancing the work of Jesus Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Companions</B> (Acts 15:37-40).&mdash;Barnabas proposed to take John Mark,
his nephew, with them on this second journey.  But Paul strenuously
objected, basing his objection on the ground that this young man had
deserted them (Acts 13:13) at a very important juncture in the first
journey.  We are told that the contention was very sharp between
Barnabas and Paul over this matter.  It was finally settled by Barnabas
taking John Mark and sailing for the island of Cyprus and Paul choosing
Silas for his companion.  When Paul came to Derbe and Lystra Timotheus
was invited to join him, which he did (Acts 16:1-4).  Luke, the author
of the Acts, goes with this company into Macedonia (Acts 16:10).  We
can trace Luke's connection with the missionaries by the "we" passages.
</P>

<P>
That Paul was afterwards reconciled to Barnabas and John Mark is shown
by his kindly mention of them in his Epistles (1 Cor. 9:6; Col. 4:10; 2
Tim 4:11; Philem. 24).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Wide Scope</B> is a marked feature of this journey of about 3,200
miles.
</P>

<P>
The first journey was through Cyprus, where Barnabas was well
acquainted, and through that section of Asia Minor roundabout the
province of Cilicia, where Paul was practically at home.  Paul was born
in Tarsus in Cilicia and it was to this region that he went for some
part of the time between his conversion and his call to the missionary
work (Acts 9:30; Gal. 1:21).
</P>

<P>
The second journey carries Paul into entirely, to him, new provinces of
Asia Minor and into Macedonia and Achaia.  He comes into close contact
not only with the rough native populations of the Asian provinces but
with the cultivated philosophers of Greece and the effeminate
voluptuaries of the heathen temples.  Here are new tests for this
missionary and the gospel which he preaches, but he meets them all.
This journey had a large significance for the spread of Christianity.
Had the gospel failed to meet the wants of all sorts and conditions of
men, there would have been no further triumphs for it.
</P>

<P>
<B>Value to the World.</B>&mdash;"This journey was not only the greatest which
Paul achieved but perhaps the most momentous recorded in the annals of
the human race.  In its issues it far outrivalled the expedition of
Alexander the Great when he carried the arms and civilization of Greece
into the heart of Asia, or that of Cæsar when he landed on the shores
of Britain, or even the voyage of Columbus when he discovered a new
world."
</P>

<P>
To Paul's turning westward, instead of eastward, through the guidance
of the Spirit, and his entering upon his work in Macedonia (Acts
16:7-11) Europe to-day owes her advancement and Christian civilization.
It is stating a sober fact when it is asserted that without
Christianity Europeans would now be worshipping idols, the same as the
inhabitants of other sections of the world where the gospel of Christ
has not been made known.
</P>

<P>
<B>Time and Rulers.</B>&mdash;In time this journey extended over about three
years, 51-54 A.D.  The rulers were: Claudius, Emperor of Rome (Nero
became Emperor in 54 A.D.); Herod Agrippa II., King of Chalcis (who
also gets Batanea and Trachontis); and Gallio, Procurator of Achaia.
</P>

<P>
<B>Epistles to the Churches.</B>&mdash;Upon this journey Paul makes a new
departure.  With the multiplication of the churches and the
impossibility of visiting them often, when occasions demanded it, Paul
begins the writing of special and circular letters to the churches.
The two first Epistles, of which we have any record, were those to The
Thessalonians from Corinth, written probably in the winter of 52-53 A.D.
</P>

<P>
NOTE.&mdash;For an account of and an analysis of these Epistles see study 7.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE ITINERARY
</H4>

<P>
<B>Through Asia Minor</B> (Acts 15:40-16:8).&mdash;It was Paul's custom to
revisit the churches which he had organized, and to care for them.
Following out this plan he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming
the churches, then to Derbe and Lystra, where he found Timotheus who
joined his company.  After visiting the churches founded on the first
missionary journey, Paul and his company turned northward and "went
throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia" (Acts 16:6) though there
is no record of any church having been founded in these regions.
"After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but
the Spirit suffered them not" (Acts 16:7).
</P>

<P>
It is important to note that the Holy Ghost now forbade Paul, at this
time, to further preach the word in Asia (Acts 16:7).  Paul and his
company tried after this to go into Bithynia but they were prevented
from doing so by the Spirit, and came down to Troas (Acts 16:8-12).  Of
this long journey through Asia Minor, of its perils and difficulties,
of the rejoicings of the former Christian converts, when they saw Paul
again, and of the many interesting facts and incidents we have only a
glimpse.
</P>

<P>
<B>In Europe</B> (Acts 16:9-18:18).&mdash;Paul, following what was to him a clear
indication of the guidance of the Holy Ghost (Acts 16:6-11), left Troas
and set out by ship, by way of Samothracia, for Neapolis, which he
reached on the following day.  There have been many conjectures as to
what the fortunes of the Christian church would have been had Paul been
allowed to carry out his intention to visit Bithynia, and to preach the
gospel in the regions of the east.  Had he done so, however, it is
quite certain, that the history of the world would have been quite
different from what it is to-day.  In this invasion of Europe Paul came
within the charmed circle of what was then the highest civilization.
The gospel was now to try its strength with the keenest philosophers
and the most seductive fascinations of immorality, masquerading under
the guise of religion in the licentious rites of the heathen temples
and groves.  What could this missionary do?  What could he preach?  If
philosophy, if art, if beauty could have saved the souls of men then
they would not have needed the gospel which Paul preached.  But this
was a gilded age, and the gilding hid the corruption, beneath.  The
message of Paul to the men in this charmed circle of civilization was
the same that he had set forth in the rough mountain towns of Asia
Minor.  Human nature, under a rough or a polished exterior, is the same
the world over.  Paul was seeking men, to bring them to a knowledge of
their alienation from God through sin, and to show them the way of
salvation through repentance and faith in Jesus Christ?  Greece, over
whom the Romans held sway at this time, had been divided into two
parts: Achaia on the south and Macedonia on the north.  A great Roman
road ran from east to west through Macedonia.  It was by this road that
the missionaries traveled.
</P>

<P>
1.  Philippi (Acts 16:12-40) will be forever memorable as the first
city in Europe in which a Christian church was established.  It had the
character of a Roman rather than a Greek city; both the civil and the
military authorities being Roman.  It had the rank of a Roman colony.
Situated as it was on the great Egnatian way travelers and traders
passed through it, eastward and westward, from all parts of the Roman
world.  "The Greek character in this northern province of Macedonia was
more vigorous and much less corrupted than in the more polished society
of the south.  The churches which Paul established here gave him more
comfort than any he established elsewhere."  The beginning of the work
at Philippi was not very promising and to most men would have been very
discouraging.  Luke tells us that "on the Sabbath we went out of the
city by a riverside where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down,
and spake unto the women which resorted hither."  But there they met
Lydia, an energetic business woman and a work was begun which has had
far reaching consequences.  Paul and his company had been but a short
time in the city when they came in conflict with the Roman authorities.
A damsel, possessed with a spirit of divination, who brought much gain
to her masters, testified to Paul and his work; this spirit Paul cast
out and in consequence the owners of the girl brought the charge
against Paul and Silas that they were Jews who taught customs not
lawful for Romans to receive.  Notice, the shrewdness of the trumped-up
charge against Paul and Silas.  Nothing is said about the real state of
the case.  In this charge the status of the Jews is shown in this city.
Paul and Silas are beaten and thrown into prison; their feet are made
fast in the stocks; their wounds are left unwashed and undressed.  But
in the earthquake, which opens the prison doors and gives release to
the prisoners, Paul has an opportunity to preach the gospel to the
jailer.  How magnificently, forgetting himself, he sets forth the way
of salvation through Christ!  We turn to the Epistle to the Philippians
(see Study 9) to see how Paul loved this church, and how this church
loved him.
</P>

<P>
2.  Thessalonica (Acts 17:1-9).  Thinking it best to leave Philippi,
Paul and his company passed on their way along the Egnatian road
through the two beautiful Greek cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia to
Thessalonica, distant about seventy-three miles from Philippi.
Thessalonica is one of the few cities which has retained its importance
up to the present time.  It was founded by Cassander, King of Macedon
in 315 B.C.  It came under the Roman rule in 168 B.C.  In Paul's time
it was a great commercial center, the inhabitants being Greeks, Romans,
and Jews.  Here was a Jewish synagogue and for three Sabbath days Paul
went into it and reasoned with the assembled Jews about Jesus Christ,
declaring to them that He was the promised Messiah, and had suffered
and was risen from the dead.  We have the same results here which
followed similar preaching elsewhere (1 Thess. 1:8).  Out of the storm
again emerges a Christian church.  Paul and his company, after the
usual tumult, pass on to another city but the church remains to send
its blessed influence through all that region.  The Epistles to the
Thessalonians (see Study 7) give us some graphic pictures of the
converts and their ways of working.
</P>

<P>
3.  Berea (Acts 17:10-14) was a secluded inland city.  It must have
been somewhat of a surprise to Paul to find the Jews of this place so
ready to receive the Word of God, which he preached to them in their
synagogue.  There was great searching of the Scriptures and many
believed.  A large work was in progress when Jews from Thessalonica,
hearing of the success of Paul in Berea, came down and stirred up the
people against him.  It became quite evident now that there was a
persistent and organized effort being made to drive Paul out of this
section.  As the opposition seemed to be directed against Paul alone,
the brethren proposed to send him away, and to have Silas and Timotheus
remain for a short time.  This plan was carried out.
</P>

<P>
4.  Athens (Acts 17:15-34) was the most cultivated city of the old
world; a statue was set upon every corner and an altar in every street.
"Here the human mind had blazed forth with a splendor it has never
exhibited elsewhere.  In the golden age of its history Athens possessed
more men of the very highest genius than have ever lived in any other
city.  To this day their names invest her with glory.  Yet even in
Paul's day the living Athens was a thing of the past.  Four hundred
years had elapsed since its golden age, and in the course of these
centuries it had experienced a sad decline.  Philosophy had degenerated
into sophistry, art into dilettanteism, oratory into rhetoric, poetry
into verse making.  It was a city living on its past."  Paul entered
into the open places where the people gathered and talked with them.
So much interest was aroused by what he had to say that he was asked to
speak to them upon Mars Hill.  Thither they all went.  Paul as his
custom was sought a common starting point in the altar to the unknown
God.  So long as he spoke of God and man in general terms he was
listened to, but when he came to touch their hearts and consciences and
to apply what he said, speaking of the judgment through Christ and His
resurrection from the dead, he was left alone.  Paul did not fail, the
trouble with the Athenians was that they possessed only intellectual
curiosity; they had no appetite for the truth.  But still some converts
were made.  "Certain men clave unto him and believed; among whom were
Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with
them" (Acts 17:34).
</P>

<P>
5.  Corinth.  (Acts 18:1-18) was the largest and most important city in
Greece.  From Athens Paul came to Corinth and remained over a year and
a half.  We have a graphic picture of this church in the Epistles to
the Corinthians.  (See Study 8.) Probably no better place than this
highway of all peoples could have been selected in which to preach the
gospel.  No one knew better than Paul how to select strategic places.
A stream of travelers, merchants, scholars, and sailors was constantly
passing through this great commercial city; what was preached here
would be carried to the ends of the earth.  It was a city of art and
culture and yet a place where the vices of the east and west met and
held high carnival.  Religion itself was put to ignoble uses; a
thousand priestesses ministered to a base worship in the magnificent
temple of the goddess Aphrodite.  Greek philosophy showed its decay in
endless discussions about words and the tendency to set intellectual
above moral distinctions.  There was a denial of the future life for
the sake of unlimited enjoyment in the present.  Paul, when he came
into the city, found a lodging with Aquila and his wife Priscilla, and
wrought with them at the occupation of tent making.  When Silas and
Timotheus joined him he openly testified to the Jews that Jesus was the
Christ.  Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, was converted
together with many Corinthians.  Paul was comforted at this time by a
vision of the Lord which bade him to speak and not to hold his peace.
After a year and a half of earnest preaching an attempt was made by the
Jews to drive Paul out of the city by bringing accusations against him
before the Roman proconsul Gallio, but in this they were unsuccessful.
Paul tarried and worked here until it seemed best for him to turn his
steps homeward again to Antioch.  The keynote of his preaching in this
city is given by him in his First Epistle to the Corinthians where he
says (2:2), "For I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus
Christ and him crucified."  If this gospel could win converts in
Corinth, it can win converts anywhere.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Return Voyage</B> (Acts 18:18-22) was by way of Ephesus where he
entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.  Leaving Ephesus
he sailed for Cæsarea where he landed.  After he had gone up and
saluted the church he went down to Antioch.

<P>
<B>Method.</B>&mdash;A study of the three missionary journeys shows the method of
evangelization of the ancient world.  The first journey was
comparatively near home.  The second was a review of the work done in
the first and a pushing on to new work in Asia Minor and the larger
conquests in Europe.  In the third we have a review visit to the
churches of Asia Minor, a long stop at Ephesus, and a review visit to
the churches of Macedonia and Achaia, which were organized upon the
second missionary journey.  There was always a method in what Paul did.
He was not only a missionary preaching and testifying to Jesus Christ,
but he was an organizer and leader of men.  The churches formed were
visited again and again; messengers were sent to them to instruct, to
chide, and to encourage them; circular and special letters from Paul's
own hand were dispatched to them, when occasion required.  Wherever
Paul preached, whatever might be the tumults raised, he always won some
adherents for Jesus Christ, who were brought together and organized
into a church.
</P>

<P>
On this third journey he was already planning to go to Rome (Acts
19:21) and wrote an epistle to the Romans announcing his coming (Rom.
1:7, 15).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chief City</B>, in which Paul spent most of his time (Acts 19:1, 8,
10), between two and three years upon this journey, was Ephesus in Asia
Minor.  This city situated midway between the extreme points of his
former missionary journeys was a place where he could have an
intelligent oversight over all the work which he had previously
accomplished.
</P>

<P>
Ephesus has been thus described: "It had been one of the early Greek
colonies, later the capital of Ionia, and in Paul's day it was by far
the largest and busiest of all the cities of proconsular Asia.  All the
roads in Asia Minor centered in Ephesus and from its position it was
almost as much a meeting place of eastern and western thought as
Alexandria.  Its religion was oriental.  Its goddess called Artemis or
Diana, had a Greek name but was the representative of an old Phrygian
nature worship.  The goddess was an inartistic, many-breasted figure,
the body carved with strange figures of animals, flowers, and fruits.
The temple built by Alexander the Great was the most magnificent
religious edifice in the world.  It was kept by a corporation of
priests and priestesses, who were supported by the rents of vast
estates.  For centuries Ephesus was a great center of pilgrimage, and
pilgrims came from all parts of Asia to visit the famous shrine."
</P>

<P>
"The first great blow which this worship received was given by Paul
during his two years' stay in Ephesus, and the story told in this
chapter is the history of the beginning of a decline from which the
worship of Diana never recovered.  The speech of Demetrius perhaps
exaggerates the effects of Paul's work, but it should be remembered
that the gospel took firm hold of proconsular Asia from a very early
period.  Paul's Epistles tell us of the churches in Ephesus, Laodicea,
and Colossæ, and the Apocalypse adds churches in Pergamos, Smyrna,
Thyatira, Sardis, and Philadelphia.  Half a century later, Pliny
asserted that in this region the temples were deserted, the worship was
neglected, and the sacrificial victims were unsold."
</P>

<P>
During his long stay in Ephesus, Paul doubtless received many
delegations and visitors from the churches formerly organized by him.
</P>

<P>
The character of the Ephesian Christians can be seen from the Epistle
addressed to them (See Study 9).
</P>

<P>
<B>Time and Extent.</B>&mdash;About four years, 54-58 A.D., were occupied by Paul
in going about among the churches and about 3,500 miles were traveled.
</P>

<P>
<B>Epistles.</B>&mdash;This journey was prolific in masterly writings.  Paul
wrote the First and Second Epistles to the Corinthians from Ephesus
about 57 A.D., Galatians from the same city (somewhere between 54 and
56 A.D.), and Romans at Corinth in 58 A.D.  (See Study 8).
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
ITINERARY
</H4>

<P>
<B>Through Galatia and Phrygia</B> (Acts 18:23).&mdash;After Paul had spent some
time at Antioch, at the close of the second missionary journey, "He
departed and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order
strengthening all the disciples."  Thus Luke briefly sums up in a few
words all the incidents of a journey of hundreds of miles of travel.
</P>

<P>
<B>Ephesus</B> (Acts 19:1-20:1).&mdash;Evidently with the purpose of showing what
is new and of chief importance in each journey Luke, as is his habit,
calls attention to the work of Paul in Ephesus; other parts of this
journey are passed over with slight mention.
</P>

<P>
Having gone through the upper coasts, Paul comes to Ephesus.  The chief
events in this city, during the visit of the Apostle, were:
</P>

<P>
1.  The incident of the work of Apollos is given (Acts 18:24-19:1) to
show how Paul found about twelve disciples of John the Baptist (Acts
19:7) at Ephesus and instructed them further, baptizing them in the
name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 19:5, compare Acts 19:1-7).
</P>

<P>
2.  Three months were spent by Paul (Acts 19:8, 9) with the Jews in
their synagogue, "disputing and persuading the things pertaining to the
kingdom of God."  But when certain of them became hardened and it was
plainly seen that little good was being done he left the synagogue.
</P>

<P>
3.  About two years' time was given, after the apostle had separated
himself and followers from the Jewish synagogue, to teaching in the
school or lecture room of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9, 10).  The result of this
preaching and teaching was that a great multitude of men and women was
brought to a confession of faith in Christ, throughout Asia.
</P>

<P>
4.  The mighty growth of the Word of God (Acts 19:20) was attested by
the miracles which Paul did in the name of Christ (Acts 19:11, 12).  He
confounded the Jewish exorcists, who attempted to imitate these
miracles (Acts 19:13-20).  This great work was shown to be a thorough
one from the fact that many who used curious arts brought their books
and burned them amounting in value to over $31,000.
</P>

<P>
5.  Paul now proposed, thinking the Ephesian church could stand alone
(Acts 19:21, 22), "after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia to
go to Jerusalem, saying, after I have been there, I must also see
Rome."  In anticipation of this visit he sent Timotheus and Erastus
into Macedonia, "but he himself stayed in Asia for a season."
</P>

<P>
6.  The tumult made by Demetrius (Acts 19:23-40) is a strong proof of
the large impression made by the gospel of Jesus Christ upon not only
the city of Ephesus but all Asia Minor.  The burning of the magical
books had arrested the attention of many people, but when the sale of
the silver images of the idol, Diana, began to fall off so as to touch
the trade of the silversmiths they were up in arms at once.  Demetrius
showed how the power of Christ had prevailed with men when he declared
that, "Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that
there be no gods which are made with hands."  The violence of the men
who composed the mob showed how deeply Christianity had taken hold upon
large numbers of people.  Paul, after the uproar had quieted down,
carried out his intention of departing for Macedonia.
</P>

<P>
<B>Through Macedonia and Greece</B> (Acts 21:1-6).&mdash;"The order of events
seems to have been: (a) Timotheus and Erastus were sent to look after
the church discipline at Corinth (Acts 19:22).  Stephanas and others
came from Corinth and returned with the First Epistle to the
Corinthians (1 Cor. 16:17).  (b) Paul meant to visit Corinth (1 Cor.
4:18, 19); instead he went to Macedonia by Troas (2 Cor. 2:12, 13).
(c) He waited at Troas for news from Corinth, and his anxiety told on
his health (2 Cor. 2:12; 1:8; 4:10, 11; 12:7).  (d) In spite of illness
he pressed on to Macedonia (2 Cor. 2:13), where he met Titus, who
brought him good news of the state of the Corinthian church (2 Cor.
7:5-9).  (e) He wrote the Second Epistle to the Corinthians and sent it
by Titus, and resolved to wait sometime longer before going to Corinth,
for he wished to take a contribution from the Corinthians to Jerusalem
(2 Cor. 9:1-5).  (f) In Macedonia he probably visited Berea,
Thessalonica, and Philippi, with perhaps a journey to Illyricum (Rom.
15:19).  (g) He went to Greece (Corinth and Cenchrea).  (h) He proposed
sailing for Syria with the contributions of the various churches, and
with delegates who carried the money; Sopater from Berea, Aristarchus
and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timotheus from
Lystra, Tychicus and Trophimus from Ephesus (Acts 20:4; 21:29).  (i)
The Jews of Corinth conspired to murder Paul on his embarkation, so his
friends went by ship, and he eluded the conspirators by going by land
to Philippi.  (j) Then he took ship for Troas, having Luke who had been
at Philippi for his companion ("We sailed").
</P>

<P>
<B>The Return Journey,</B> Troas to Jerusalem (Acts 20:6-21:15).
</P>

<P>
1.  Troas.  Luke and Paul were five days in reaching Troas, from
Philippi, where they found a number of the brethren who had preceded
them (Acts 20:6, compare Acts 20:4-6).  Seven days were spent at Troas
(Acts 20:6).  We have here the record of how the disciples spent the
Sabbath day in breaking bread together and in listening to the
preaching of Paul.  (Acts 20:7-12).  This last day here came near being
marred by Eutychus meeting his death, when he fell down from the third
loft.  But Paul was there and Eutychus's life was spared.  The meeting
did not break up until the next morning, so interested were they in
talking over "The Way."
</P>

<P>
2.  Troas to Miletus (Acts 20:13-15).  Paul's company went by ship
first to Assos, where Paul met them; he having covered the distance of
about twenty miles on foot.  At Assos Paul joined the company on the
ship and they sailed from Assos to Mitylene.  "And we sailed thence,"
says Luke, "and came the next day over against Chios; and the next day
we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next day we
came to Miletus."
</P>

<P>
3.  At Miletus (Acts 20:17-38) Paul sent for the elders of the Ephesian
church to come to him.  When they came he spoke to them in a very
touching and tender way.  This address has been divided into four
parts: (a) What was behind Paul; he called them to witness that he had
been faithful in declaring to them the full gospel of Jesus Christ,
repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.  (b) What was
before Paul; he said that in every city the Holy Ghost witnessed that
bonds and afflictions awaited him.  (c) What was before the elders of
the Ephesian church; it was theirs to take care of the flock over which
they presided and "to feed the church of God."  (d) Commendation of the
elders to God in their good work.  (e) Paul's earnest prayer for their
welfare.  (f) The farewell words.
</P>

<P>
4.  Miletus to Cæsarea and Jerusalem (Acts 21:1-15) by way of Coos,
Rhodes, Patara, Tyre, and Cæsarea.  At Tyre there was a wait of seven
days and a change of ships; in this city it was testified to Paul that
he should not go up to Jerusalem.  At the parting, when Paul and his
company took ship to go to Cæsarea, the disciples of Tyre came out to
see them off and all kneeled down on the shore and prayed.  At Cæsarea
where Paul's company tarried many days, it was again made known to Paul
by the Holy Ghost that bonds and imprisonment awaited him at Jerusalem,
but still he pressed on saying, "The will of the Lord be done."
Arriving in Jerusalem they were gladly received by the brethren.

</H4>

<H5 ALIGN="center">
<I>Scripture, Acts 21:17-28:31</I>
</H5>

<P>
<B>From Jerusalem to Rome.</B>&mdash;This portion of the book of the Acts
comprises more than one quarter of the whole, or seven and a half
chapters.  There must have been some important purpose to be served by
thus relating so fully the incidents of this period in Paul's life; for
Luke elsewhere narrates only the incidents of the missionary journeys
which are of great interest.  It may be that his purpose was to show,
with the full connecting incidents, how clearly and strongly Paul
testified, to the Jews in the temple (Acts 22:1-23), and before the
Roman tribunal (Acts 25:13, 14, 26; 26:1-32), that Jesus was the
Christ.  Jesus himself, before his death, gave the same testimony to
the Sanhedrin (Matt. 26:63, 64; Mark 14:61, 62; Luke 22:67-69), and the
Roman tribunal (John 18:33-37).  The testimony of Paul was further
carried to imperial Rome, the capital of the world (Acts 28:17-24).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Seven Speeches.</B>&mdash;The last recorded addresses of the Great Apostle
are a striking feature of this period.  They show his faith after it
had been tried and tested in his toilsome years of missionary labors.
They reveal the courage and character of the man in that they were
given when he was in bonds and in imminent peril of his life.
</P>

<P>
1.  The speech before the Jewish mob in the temple (Acts 22:1-29) in
which Paul tells the Jews how he was changed from a persecutor to a
believer in Christ.  He relates also the story of his conversion.
</P>

<P>
2.  The speech before the Jewish council (Acts 22:30; 23:1-10) in which
he creates confusion by raising the question of the resurrection.  But
the provocation was great for the high-priest had commanded that Paul
be smitten on the mouth when he began to speak.
</P>

<P>
3.  The speech before Felix, the Roman governor (Acts 24:10-22) in
which he makes his defense against Jewish accusers, and affirms his
belief in the new "Way" and in the resurrection.
</P>

<P>
4.  The speech before Felix and Brasilia, his wife, (Acts 24:24-27).
Paul, being sent for by Felix to tell him of his faith in Christ,
reasons "of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come."
</P>

<P>
5.  The speech before Festus the Roman governor (Acts 25:7-11) in which
Paul appeals to Cæsar.
</P>

<P>
6.  The speech before Festus, the Roman governor, and King Agrippa and
his wife, Bernice, (Acts 25:13; 26:1-32).  Here Paul again relates the
story of his conversion and shows that Jesus is the Christ.
</P>

<P>
7.  The speech before the chief Jews in Rome (Acts 28:17-31) showing
that Jesus is the Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Writings.</B>&mdash;During the two years' imprisonment of Paul in Cæsarea
we have no account of any Epistles written by him.  But when he arrives
in Rome he again begins to indite those writings which have made his
name so famous.  From his prison in Rome he sent out four letters which
have been called, "The Epistles of the First Imprisonment"; Colossians,
Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians (See Chapter 9).  For profound
expositions of the Christian doctrines, lofty ethical teaching, and
mellowness of feeling they stand unequalled.
</P>

<P>
<B>Time and Extent.</B>&mdash;Paul arrived in Jerusalem in 58 A.D.  He was
imprisoned two years in Cæsarea, 58 to 60 A.D.  The voyage to Rome was
in the winter of 60 and 61 A D.  He was imprisoned in Rome two years,
61 to 63 A.D.  In extent the journey which Paul took from Cæsarea to
Rome was about 2,300 miles.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Historical Connections.</B>&mdash;Nero was Emperor of Rome (since 54
A.D.).  Felix was Procurator of Judea from 51 to 60 A.D., when he was
succeeded by Festus.  We fix the date of Paul's going to Rome by the
fact that when Festus came in 60 A.D., he made his appeal to Cæsar.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
PAUL AT JERUSALEM
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Return</B> to Jerusalem (Acts 21:17-23:23) was at the feast of
Pentecost when it was crowded with strangers from all parts of the
world.  Paul had been warned not to come back to this city (Acts
21:10-14) and it might have been possible for him to have remained
away, passing the last years of his life in high honor and peace as the
Great Apostle and Head of the Gentile churches.  But he seems to have
felt it incumbent upon him to return to Jerusalem and testify for his
faith (Acts 21:14), and to carry alms (Acts 24:17).  Paul was now about
sixty years of age and for more than ten years had been engaged in the
most arduous missionary labors, enduring stonings, beatings, and
contumelies of all kinds, for the sake of preaching Jesus Christ.  More
than twenty years had elapsed since his conversion; and before his
well-known three missionary journeys he had been actively engaged in
the work which he loved so well.  In his body he must have borne the
marks of these incessant labors, but his spirit was as fresh and
undaunted as ever.  Whatever awaited him in Jerusalem he was ready for
it.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Meeting with James and the Elders of the Church</B> (Acts 21:17-25)
seems to have been a pleasant one.  Paul told his story of the wonders
wrought in the Gentile world, and God was glorified, but there seems to
have been a certain constraint upon the company.  Paul was well known
everywhere as an exponent of that liberty in Christ by which the
Gentiles when they became Christians were not obliged to become Jews
and obey the laws of Moses.  We find the elders, while freely admitting
the binding nature of the decision of the Jerusalem Council upon this
matter, advising him to show the many thousands of Jews who believed
and kept the law, that he himself still held to the observance of the
law.  Hence the urgency with which they requested him to purify himself
in the temple, with certain men who had a vow, so that the Jews might
see that he was not a renegade.  The consequences of this advice soon
became evident.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Temple Riot and Paul's Imprisonment</B> (Acts 21:26-39).&mdash;When the
days of purification for his companions were almost completed some Jews
of Asia saw him and at once raised a great tumult.  It is a wonder that
he was not seen and recognized earlier.  Doubtless the Asian Jews had
been restrained in their own cities from wreaking their hatred upon
Paul to the full, by the strong arm of the Roman magistrate.  At once a
great outcry was raised and Paul would have fared badly if he had not
been rescued by the Roman soldiers, to be imprisoned by them.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Speech of Paul to the Rioters</B> (Acts 21:40-22:23).&mdash;He requested
that he be permitted to speak to this angry crowd of fanatic Jews, who
were howling for his life.  What would he say?  What defense could he
make?  Listen to him!  He is telling the story of his life and
conversion, on the way to Damascus.  He is glorifying Jesus and urging
them to believe in Him.  There is not one word about the indignities
that have been heaped upon himself.  This personal testimony in this
city where Paul had been the chief persecutor was wonderful.  But as
the Jews had demanded the life of Christ, when he was upon earth and
testified to His mission, so now they demanded the life of Paul.
</P>

<P>
<B>Before the Jewish Council</B> (Acts 22:24-23:10).&mdash;Paul, rescued from the
clutches of the mob, would have been scourged by the Romans had he not
declared himself a Roman.  On the morrow, taken before the Sanhedrin,
and seeing no hope of any justice being done him, he sets one party of
it over against the other by declaring that he was a Pharisee and "of
the hope of the resurrection of the dead I am called in question."  So
great was the dissension that arose over this matter that Paul was
faring badly when he was rescued by the chief captain and his soldiers.
</P>

<P>
<B>Paul Comforted by God</B> (Acts 23:10).&mdash;Paul must have been quite worn
out with the tumults and mobs of the last two days.  The encouragement
of God speaking to him and telling him to be of good cheer, and that as
he had testified of Him in Jerusalem, he must also bear witness in
Rome, put a new heart in him.  It had been Paul's great desire to visit
Rome and preach Christ in that city (Rome 1:11-15; Acts 19:21).
</P>

<P>
<B>Conspiracy of Jewish Fanatics</B> (Acts 23:10-30).&mdash;The mad hatred of the
Jews against Paul is shown by more than forty men binding themselves
under a curse to kill him.  The astonishing thing about this conspiracy
is that the conspirators showed what they proposed to do to the chief
priests and elders and asked their aid to bring Paul down for another
examination that they might kill him.  The plot was brought to naught
by Paul's nephew, who heard of it and told Paul.  This information was
at once given to the chief captain, who determined to send Paul away
that night to the Roman governor at Cæsarea.  It was a large escort,
200 legionaries, 200 light armed troops, skirmishers, and 70 cavalry,
which was sent out with Paul.  This great company of soldiers showed
the immanent danger in which Paul stood at this time.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
PAUL AT CÆSAREA
</H4>

<H5 ALIGN="center">
<I>Scripture, Acts 23:33-27:1</I>
</H5>

<P>
Paul now comes under Roman jurisdiction and remains for two years (Acts
24:27) a prisoner in Cæsarea.  He is not kept in close confinement and
his friends are allowed to see him (Acts 24:23).  Who came to see him
of these friends and what they talked about Luke does not tell us.  Our
attention seems to be purposely directed to the defense which Paul made
of his faith and work before the Roman governors, Felix and Festus, and
the Jewish King Agrippa II.  As Pilate had seen no just cause why
Christ should be condemned to death, so Felix and Festus, when Paul had
testified of his faith in Christ before them, saw no reason why he
should suffer the death penalty.
</P>

<P>
<B>The First Defense; before Jewish Accusers and the Roman Governor,
Felix</B> (Acts 23:33-24:23).&mdash;Awaiting the coming of his accusers from
Jerusalem Paul was kept in Herod's judgment hall.  After five days
Ananias, with the elders, and an orator, named Tertullus, came to
Cæsarea, and charged Paul with being "a mover of sedition among all the
Jews throughout the world, and a ring-leader of the sect of the
Nazarenes"; they also accused him of profaning the temple.
</P>

<P>
Paul being beckoned by the governor to speak replied in answer to the
charges made against him: (a) That Felix, who has been governor so long
(since 51 A.D.), must know from personal knowledge, that he had not
been engaged in any sedition and that this charge could not be proved
against him.  It had only been twelve days since he went up to
Jerusalem and a number of them had been spent in Roman custody.  During
this period there had been no time to plot against the government.  (b)
While he worshipped God after the way that they called heresy, yet he
believed all that was written in the law and the prophets.  He had come
he said "after many years to bring alms to my nation, and offerings."
It was true that certain Jews had found him "purified in the temple,
neither with multitude, nor with tumult."  These ought to have been
present and to have testified to these things.  (c) He denied that he
had committed any sacrilege.  When he was seized in the temple he was
in the very act of performing a portion of the worship prescribed by
the Mosaic law.  (d) The knowledge of those present "went no further
than that they had heard him declare his belief in the doctrine of the
resurrection from the dead" (Acts 22:30-23:1-6).  Upon the conclusion
of Paul's argument, Felix adjourned the case until Lysias, the chief
captain, should come down and give his testimony.
</P>

<P>
<I>Second Defense; before Felix and his Wife, Drusilla</I> (Acts
24:24-27).&mdash;This was evidently a private hearing of Paul of his faith
in Christ.  There was ample reason for the trembling of Felix when Paul
"reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come."  Felix
was a notoriously unjust ruler who had taken bribes, murdered a
high-priest and, relying upon the influence of his infamous brother
Pallas at Rome, was steeped in crimes.  He had induced his wife
Drusilla to desert her husband to marry him.  Felix showed his
character when he sent for Paul a number of times and communed with
him, hoping to receive a bribe.  When recalled to Rome in consequence
of repeated complaints of his misadministration of justice he, "willing
to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound."
</P>

<P>
<B>Third Defense; before Festus, the New Governor</B> (Acts
25:1-12).&mdash;Festus, Josephus tells us, was one of the best procurators
of Judea.  He was appointed by Nero in the year 60 A.D., and died two
years after this.  He is importuned by "the high-priest and the chief
of the Jews, as soon as he takes office, to send Paul back to Jerusalem
(in order that he might be killed on the way thither).  Festus replies
that they are to come to Cæsarea and there make their accusations
against Paul.  When they are come and Festus sits on the judgment seat
they make "many and grievous complaints against Paul which they could
not prove."  Paul's answer is: neither against the law of the Jews,
neither against the temple, nor yet against Cæsar, have I offended in
anything at all."  But Festus showed, notwithstanding his many good
traits, a decided leaning toward Paul's accusers.  When therefore
Festus asked Paul if he would go back to Jerusalem and be there judged
before the Sanhedrin, Paul recognizes the hopelessness of his case and
exercised his right as a Roman citizen in taking an appeal to the
judgment seat of Cæsar.  This right of appeal was one of the most
important prerogatives of the Roman citizen; he had only to say the
word, "Appello" and proceedings must at once be stopped; his case must
go to the court of the emperor.  In exercising this appeal Paul very
justly said that if he had done anything worthy of death he was willing
to die, but if the charges made against him by the Jewish high-priest
and elders were not true he ought not to be delivered up to them.
</P>

<P>
<B>Fourth Defense; before Festus and King Agrippa II.</B>&mdash;In Acts 25:13-27
we have an account of the visit of Jewish King Agrippa II. to Festus
and the statement of the latter in regard to the case of Paul.  Festus
is at a loss what to write about the prisoner, to the imperial court
(Acts 25:25-27), the accusations of the Jews having failed of proof.
To send a prisoner to Cæsar and not be able to state clearly what his
crime was might involve Festus in difficulties.  Agrippa, as a Jew,
might be able to give some light upon this matter.  The question seemed
to be in regard to religious freedom.  Rome did not allow religious
liberty.  The Jewish religion, however, was licensed as one of the
forms under which men were allowed to worship God in the Roman empire.
Agrippa might be able to solve this question as to whether Paul was or
was not within his legal rights and the Christianity which he professed
be as legal as Judaism.
</P>

<P>
Paul in his argument (Acts 26:1-29) before Festus and King Agrippa II.,
took the ground that Christianity, as an outgrowth of Judaism, had a
legal status.  Paul said that he preached that the Messiah had come in
the person of Jesus Christ and this was the One whom Moses and the
prophets had foretold, (a) Paul's introduction is very courteous.  He
recognizes King Agrippa as well versed "in all customs and questions
which are among the Jews."  (b) He declares his early life to be well
known, as a Jew, and, of the strictest sect, a Pharisee.  (c) He stands
accused because he believes that the Messiah, whom all Jews are praying
may come, has come.  (c) Here, as Prof. Lindsay says, in his commentary
on the Acts, "Agrippa may by look, word, or gesture have suggested, A
crucified Messiah! and Paul have answered, No, but a risen Redeemer!
Is it incredible that God should raise the dead?"  Then Paul continues
saying, that he himself was an enemy of Christ at first.  (d) Paul
proceeds with his argument, giving his personal testimony, how this
risen Messiah had appeared to him on the way to Damascus and what He
had said to him.  (e) Then he shows how it had been foretold by the
prophets and Moses that Christ should suffer "and that He should be the
first that should rise from the dead, and should show forth light unto
the people, and to the Gentiles."
</P>

<P>
The argument is over and after certain remarks, by Festus and Agrippa
which are characteristic of both men, there is a conference and a
decision rendered by the Roman governor and Jewish King, "That this man
doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds."  But the appeal to Cæsar
cannot be set aside and Paul must go to Rome.

THE VOYAGE TO ROME
</H4>

<H5 ALIGN="center">
<I>Scripture, Acts 21:1-28:31</I>
</H5>

<P>
Paul now begins his long delayed trip to Rome not, however, as he
expected a free man, but as a prisoner.  He comes finally to Rome and
there testifies of his faith in Christ.  His native force of character
and Christian graces bring him to the front upon this voyage and in the
time of shipwreck he takes over the command.

Three ships convey him to Rome, one of which is cast away on the island

<B>Cæsarea to Myra</B> (a city of Lycia) or the fortunes of Paul upon the
first ship (Acts 27:1-5).  Aristarchus and Luke were the companions who
embarked with the Great Apostle upon a ship of Adramyttium.  Paul was
in charge of Julius, "a centurion of Augustus's band."  The first stop
was at Sidon where Paul was given "liberty to go unto his friends and
refresh himself."  The ship then sailed for the city of Myra in Lycia
passing to the east and north of the island of Cyprus.
</P>

<P>
<B>Myra to the Island of Melita</B>, or the fortunes of Paul upon the second
ship (27:6-28:10).  Arrived at the city of Myra the whole company
changed ships, re-embarking in a large ship which was probably engaged
in the grain carrying trade between Alexandria in Egypt and Rome.  This
portion of the voyage was full of difficulties from the beginning.
From Myra to Cnidus (a peninsula which projected from the Carian coast
having Cos on the north and Rhodes on the south) the progress against
baffling winds was slow.  The first stop was made at Fair Havens, a
place upon the southern coast of Crete (the modern Candia).  It was
here that Paul foretold the serious danger to the ship if the voyage
should be continued.  But the centurion taking the advice of the master
and owner of the ship, and because the harbour "was not commodious to
winter in," determined to make an attempt to reach Phenice (a harbour
west of Crete and upon the same side of the island).  The adventures
that befell the ship's company, and, the misfortune that came to the
ship, in the terrible fourteen days that followed after the departure
from Fair Havens are best understood through the graphic language of
Luke, an eye witness (Acts 27:14-44 should be read carefully in this
connection).  It is in this time of trial that Paul steps forth and
shows his mastery over men.  Comforted himself by "the angel of God" he
comforts others in declaring that no harm shall come to the lives of
those in the ship.  In the midst of this great storm he alone is calm
and able to insist that his companions keep up their courage and
strength, and not to give away to despair.  The island of Melita (the
modern Malta), where the shipwreck took place, lies directly south of
Sicily.  The place where the Great Apostle was cast ashore is now known
as St. Paul's Bay.  The inhabitants of the island received the ship's
company "with no little kindness" and Paul engaged here in a healing
ministry, curing the father of Publius, the chief man of the island, of
a fever and many others of diseases.  In whatever place or
circumstances Paul comes he at once begins to exercise his Christian
gifts.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Island of Melita to Rome</B>, or the adventures of Paul on the third
ship (Acts 28:11-16).  Three months were spent at Melita.  Then Paul
and the company embarked on another Alexandrian grain ship for Puteoli,
"eight miles southwest of Naples and the principal harbour south of
Rome in Paul's day."  "It was the port at which the Egyptian grain
ships usually unloaded."  There were two stops made on the way to
Puteoli, one at Syracuse in Sicily and the other at Rhegium, at the
southern point of Italy.  At Puteoli Paul found Christian brethren with
whom he remained for seven days.  The Roman Christians came but to meet
Paul at Apii Forum, forty-three miles, and the Three Taverns,
thirty-three miles from Rome.  This expression of love and interest in
him and his welfare greatly cheered the heart of the Apostle.

PAUL AT ROME
</H4>

<P>
<B>Testifying to the Jews</B> (Acts 28:17-27).&mdash;After an interval of only
three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together, and explained to
them why he had been sent to Rome.  He declared that he had no
accusation to make against his nation to the Roman authorities, but
that he was a prisoner on account of his advocacy of the hope of Israel
fulfilled in Jesus Christ.  But the Jews replied that they had had no
word about Paul from Jerusalem.  Desiring to hear more of what Paul had
to say about the Christians they appointed a day in which they would
hear Paul at his lodgings.  This hearing was evidently very thorough,
and the usual division was made of believing and unbelieving Jews.
</P>

<P>
<B>Testifying to the Gentiles</B> (Acts 28:28).&mdash;Paul receiving no
sufficient response to his words from the Jews now turns his attention
to the Gentiles.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Two Years' Imprisonment</B> (Acts 28:30, 31) was spent in preaching
the gospel of Jesus Christ, in his own hired house, and receiving all
who came to him.  Although Paul was a prisoner he was allowed complete
freedom of speech.
</P>

<P>
<B>Incidental Notices of this Imprisonment</B> are found in the four
Epistles which were written from Rome during its continuance.  Prof. J.
R. Lumby, D.D. (Acts, Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges) says:
"We know from first to last the prisoner's chain hurt Paul (Eph. 3:1;
4:1; Phil. 1:13, 16; Col. 4:18; Philem. 1, 9, 10), and that his cause
was at times an object of much anxiety (Phil. 2:23, 24).  We also learn
from the same letters that besides Luke and Aristarchus (Acts 27:2;
28:15) he had also the fellowship, for some time at least, of Tychicus,
who (Eph. 6:21) was the bearer of his letter to Ephesus; of Timothy,
whom (Phil. 1:1; Col. 1:1; Philem. 1) he joins with himself in the
greeting to the churches of Philippi and Colossæ and also in that to
Philemon.  In the former of these churches Timothy had been a fellow
laborer with the Apostle.  Epaphroditus came with the Philippian
contributions to the aid of the imprisoned Apostle (Phil. 4:18).
Onesimus found out Paul when in flight from his master he made his way
to Rome (Col. 4:9; Philem. 10).  Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, was also
there and another Jewish convert, Jesus, called Justus, of whom we only
know that the Apostle considered him worthy to be called a fellow
worker unto the kingdom of God (Col. 4:11).  Epaphras from the churches
of Laodicea and Hieropolis, had come to visit Paul, and to bring him
greetings doubtless of the Christians there, and carry back some words
of earnest council and advice from the Roman prisoner (Col. 4:12, 13).
Last of all Demas was there to be mentioned as having forsaken the good
way through love of this present world (Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:10).  More
than this and the few words in verses thirty and thirty-one, of Acts
28, we do not know of this first imprisonment."  His spirit however was
unsubdued through all his hardships and he was ever exhorting the
disciples of Christ to rejoice in Him (Phil. 2:1, 2; 4:4).

INTRODUCTION TO THE EPISTLES OF PAUL
</H4>

<P>
<B>Epistolary Writings.</B>&mdash;The New Testament is composed of twenty-seven
books, twenty-one of which are Epistles.  Of this latter number
thirteen are ascribed to Paul.  It is thus seen how largely the New
Testament is made up of Epistles and how many of these are attributed
to the Great Apostle.
</P>

<P>
In the letters of men of great prominence and power of any age we get
closer to the real condition of the affairs of that age than by any
other means.  In this way, we get information at first hand from the
participants in the events of which they write.  It is fortunate for us
that we have this first hand material with which to deal, when we come
to study the early growth and development of Christianity.
</P>

<P>
By means of the New Testament Epistles (which are real letters and
written with a definite purpose in view) we look directly into the
faith, the customs, and practices of the early Christian churches.  We
see how they were organized and how they conducted their services.  We
see the marvelous changes wrought in the lives and characters of the
converts.  We note that the triumphs of faith were won through a belief
in the Divine Son of God and the power of the Holy Ghost.  The
struggles and difficulties of these early Christians in coming out of
heathenism are depicted in a masterly way.  Paul, in his endeavor to
guide aright the churches, of which he had been the spiritual father,
shows what he believes and teaches about God, the Holy Ghost, Jesus
Christ, sin, redemption, and the future state of the soul.  In these
letters the incidental and indirect references to the doctrines taught,
and the customs of the early churches, are as valuable as the direct.
</P>

<P>
<B>Some Reasons for Paul's Writings.</B>&mdash;The Apostle was the founder of
churches over a large area of territory.  He soon realized, however,
that it was impossible to visit them as often as he desired and as
frequently as he ought.  Many of the converts had come out of
heathenism and needed doctrinal and ethical instruction in the way of
Christ.  They also needed encouragement, comfort, and sometimes sharp
correction for outbreaking sins.  As means of communication were open
and easy along the well kept Roman roads, what was more natural than
that Paul should begin to write letters which were not only to be read
by the particular churches to which they were addressed, but passed on
to the other churches.
</P>

<P>
<B>Qualifications of Paul.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Intellectual.  He was not only pre-eminent as a missionary, but
even more remarkable as a writer.  "He was the greatest thinker of his
age, if not of any age, who in the midst of his outward labors was
producing writings which have ever since been among the mightiest
intellectual forces of the world and are still growing."
</P>

<P>
2.  Spiritual.  He had been converted in a wonderful way and had
received a special revelation from Christ (Acts 9:3-15; 1 Cor. 15:3;
Gal. 1:11, 12).  He had been called to his great work among the
Gentiles by Christ and the Holy Ghost (Acts 9:15; 13:2).  He was
absolutely absorbed in the work of Christ and in making known His
gospel.
</P>

<P>
<B>How the Epistles are Best Understood.</B>&mdash;Each one should be studied in
the light of the occasion which called it forth and in connection with
the church, group of churches, or the individual to which it is
addressed.
</P>

<P>
<B>Titles and Groups.</B>&mdash;The thirteen Epistles fall naturally into four
groups; in each of which is set forth some great doctrinal and ethical
truth.
</P>

<P>
First Group, First and Second Thessalonians.  "These Epistles are
short, simple, and practical.  They may be regarded as illustrating
Paul's earlier missionary instruction to his converts&mdash;hence the name
'Missionary Epistles,' sometimes applied to them.  They treat of but
one doctrinal subject&mdash;the second coming of Christ."  It should be
borne in mind, however, that Paul speaks of Jesus Christ as "The Lord,"
"Our Lord," about twenty-five times in First Thessalonians; this shows
how thoroughly he believed in the Deity of Christ.
</P>

<P>
Second Group, Galatians, First and Second Corinthians and Romans.
"This group is the great repertory of Paul's doctrinal and ethical
teaching.  Galatians and Romans deal chiefly with his doctrine of
justification by faith.  They are designed to disprove the current
Jewish teaching (which was invading the churches) that men might be
saved by obedience to the Mosaic law.  On the contrary Paul maintained
that the sole basis of salvation is the grace of God to be appropriated
by faith on man's part."
</P>

<P>
Third Group, Colossians, Philemon, Ephesians, and Philippians.  "This
group is predominantly Christological.  Errors had invaded the churches
addressed, which tended to degrade the person and work of Christ, and
the Apostle writes with a view to showing his pre-eminence and saving
power, so that the readers may be induced to keep their allegiance to
Christ and His gospel."
</P>

<P>
Fourth Group, First Timothy, Titus and Second Timothy.  "These are
called 'The Pastoral Epistles,' and were designed to instruct Timothy
and Titus as superintendents of the churches in Ephesus and Crete, and
were thus semi-official in character.  But they have also a strong
personal element and a tone of warm sympathy and affection."  The above
characterization of the four groups of these Epistles by Prof. G. B.
Stevens is brief and to the point.
</P>

<P>
<B>Common Plan.</B>&mdash;The plan in all of Paul's Epistles, with slight
variations, is much the same.  The outlines of these letters fall
uniformly into six divisions.  "First, a greeting sometimes very brief,
sometimes extending over several verses, in which he generally manages
with consummate skill to strike the keynote of the whole letter.
Secondly, a thanksgiving to God for the Christian gifts and graces of
his converts.  Thirdly, a doctrinal part, in which he argues out or
explains some great topic of Christian truth, specially required by the
condition of the church to which he is writing.  Fourthly, a practical
section, in which he applies to daily moral duties the great doctrines
which he has developed.  Fifthly, personal messages, salutations, and
details.  Sixthly, a brief autograph conclusion to ratify the
genuineness of the entire letter."
</P>

<P>
<B>The Supreme Purpose</B> was to make known the Divine Christ as the Savior
of all men, both Jew and Gentile (1 Cor. 2:1-16; Col. 1:9-29; Phil.
2:9-11; Acts 26:22, 23; Rom. 3:9-31).

FIRST GROUP OF EPISTLES
</H4>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE FIRST AND SECOND EPISTLES TO THE THESSALONIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>The First Group of Epistles.</B>&mdash;The First and Second Epistles to the
Thessalonians are the earliest writings of Paul of which we have any
certain knowledge.  He may possibly have written earlier epistles,
which are now lost.  He speaks of writing a salutation "in every
epistle" (2 Thess. 3:17), "with mine own hand," which may imply that he
had already written a number of Epistles.  In regard to later writings
he also speaks of an Epistle (1 Cor. 5:9) to the Corinthians written to
them before that now known as First Corinthians and of one written to
the Laodiceans (Col. 4:16); of these writings we have no record save
these incidental notices, if these notices refer to lost Epistles.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Chief Doctrinal Point</B> considered in this group is "The Future of
Christ's Kingdom" as it was related to His second coming (1 Thess.
4:13-5:9, compare 2 Thess. 2:1-17).  It was natural that, after so
great a manifestation of the Divine Christ, the earlier believers in
Him should make much of the promise that He said He would come again,
and amid their troubles and difficulties the strong tendency would be
to think that second coming was close at hand.  It is a well known fact
however that the near approach of a great joy or sorrow unfits men and
women for the ordinary pursuits of life.  Paul, in his first letter to
the members of the church of Thessalonica, spoke of the second coming
of Christ to relieve their minds of a worry over those who had died
since he had preached to them (lest they should not see the Lord when
He came), and also to encourage them in their faith (1 Thess. 4:13-18).
It seems that Paul was taken to mean by what he wrote that Christ's
coming was near at hand.  The believers in Christ, in Thessalonica,
began to give up their ordinary avocations and pursuits in speedy
anticipation of this great event.  He therefore takes occasion in his
second letter to the church to correct the impression that Christ's
coming (2 Thess. 2:1-17) was near at hand.  He exhorts them to true and
faithful living in the sight of their Lord Jesus Christ (2 Thess.
3:1-18) as the best way to serve their Divine Master.  The principle of
the true Christian life is here set forth in a masterly way; it holds
good for all time and all peoples.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE FIRST EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Founding of the Church at Thessalonica</B> (Acts 17:1-10).&mdash;Paul was
on his second missionary journey and this church was the second which
he organized in Europe.  He entered into the synagogue at Thessalonica
and three Sabbath days reasoned with the Jews out of the scriptures,
"opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered and risen
again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is
Christ" (Acts 17:3).  Through this preaching a few of the Jews believed
"and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not
a few."  It appears from this account that the church was mostly made
up of Gentiles.  But through the opposition of the Jews all the city
was set in an uproar and Paul was sent away by night to Berea.
</P>

<P>
<B>Occasion, Time, and Place of Writing.</B>&mdash;Paul left Thessalonica
unwillingly for he had a great affection for his converts in this city.
Twice he endeavored to return, but was prevented from doing so (2:17,
18).  When he reached Athens (Acts 17:15) he grew so anxious about the
church at Thessalonica that he sent Timothy back to see how it
prospered (3:1, 2).  While Timothy was gone on his mission Paul went on
to Corinth (Acts 18:1).  Here Timothy found him when he returned with
his report of the church (Acts 18:5; 1 Thess. 3:6).  Paul was greatly
pleased with what Timothy had to say about the converts.  While
enduring persecution they were standing fast in the Lord and devoted to
their faith in Christ (3:7-13).  The report which Timothy brought was
the occasion of the first letter to this church.
</P>

<P>
The time was, in all probability, in the winter of 52-53 A.D., and the
place of writing was at Corinth, where Paul remained for over a year
and a half (Acts 18:1, 11, 18).
</P>

<P>
<B>Contents.</B>&mdash;The first three chapters are of a personal character and
show how dear to Paul's heart were these converts of Thessalonica.
They also show the good record made for the short time since they had
embraced Christianity.  But nothing could be more revolutionary in
those days than to become a Christian; therefore Paul takes occasion to
correct social, moral, and doctrinal faults and to instruct them more
fully in the faith, in Christ, which they professed.  In the matter of
doctrine Paul mentions Christ as "the Lord," "our Lord" about
twenty-five times, showing his belief in and teaching of the Deity of
Christ.  In regard to Christ's speedy second coming, of which many seem
to have had a lively expectation so that they were troubled when some
died lest these had lost their opportunity to see this glorious event,
Paul writes to reassure them that all believers, those who have died
and those who are alive at that time, "will enter together and share
equally in the blessings of Christ's heavenly kingdom" (4:13-18).  The
Epistle closes with exhortations to be joyful, thankful, and prayerful.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>

1.  Introduction (1:1-10).  Personal address and salutation.
Thanksgiving for their faith, love and hope in Jesus Christ and for
their conversion.

2.  Narrative (2:1-4:12).  How the gospel was given and how it was
received at Thessalonica.  An account of Paul's care and anxiety for
the church.  Paul's prayer for their establishment in the faith of
Jesus Christ.  Exhortation to abstain as followers of Christ from
impurity and fraud; to follow after holiness and brotherly love.
</P>

<P>
3.  Doctrinal (4:13-5:11).  The second advent of Christ.  The parts
which the dead and living will have when Christ shall come again.  The
uncertainty of the time.  The need of constant watchfulness.

<P>
4.  Practical (5:12-28).  Rules for the conduct of the church, its
overseers and members.  Exhortation to be joyful, prayerful, and

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE THESSALONIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>Occasion, Time, and Place of Writing.</B>&mdash;What Paul wrote about the
second coming of Christ, in the First Epistle, seems to have been
misunderstood by the church at Thessalonica (1:7-3:11).  Then too there
was probably a spurious epistle (and this may have occasioned much of
the trouble) in circulation, in which Paul is evidently made to declare
that the day of Christ is close at hand (2:2).  He writes of this false
epistle very vigorously that they be not troubled in spirit by a
letter, "as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."  Evidently
some were neglecting their work, becoming impatient at the delay in
Christ's coming (3:5, 11, 12) and walking disorderly.
</P>

<P>
The Epistle opens, with an expression of thanks for the general
condition of the church and that it was enduring persecutions and
tribulations well (1:2-6).  Hence it is evident that some but not all
of the church members were out of accord with an earnest sensible faith
in Christ.  This Epistle reflects certain conditions which Paul had to
meet in his work and shows how he sought to check any defections from
right conceptions of true Christian doctrine and life.  In the second
chapter Paul shows that the "day of Christ" may not speedily come, that
certain other things must come to pass before it is revealed (compare
Matthew ch. 24), and that the true Christian way is to stand fast
always in the Lord.  In thus standing fast every believer will grow in
faith and grace.
</P>

<P>
The duties taught are "courage and faith under persecution and calmness
and quiet industry in the presence of the greatest expectations."
</P>

<P>
The time of writing was probably, a few months after that of the First
Epistle, in 53 A.D.  The place of writing was Corinth.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Introduction (1:1-4).  Salutation.  Thanksgiving for the growth of
faith in the Thessalonian church.
</P>

<P>
2.  Doctrinal (1:5-2:17).  The great day of the Lord.  The
Thessalonians seemingly misunderstood Paul's first letter and he now
more fully explains the second advent of Christ.  It will be a day of
terrible retribution for the unbeliever but one of glory for all who
trust in Him.  A warning is given not to think the day near at hand.
Certain things must first come to pass; "a falling away," "a man of
sin," "signs and lying wonders."  Thanksgiving that the Thessalonians
have been chosen to salvation through the sanctification of the Spirit.
</P>

<P>
3.  Conclusion (Ch. 3).  Paul requests prayer for himself that "the
word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified" with him; he
also desires that the Lord may direct their "hearts into the love of
God and into the patient waiting for Christ."  Paul gives command to
discipline the disorderly and that every man earn his own living.
Exhortation to be not weary in well doing.  Salutation and benediction.

PROBLEMS OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Old Faiths and the New.</B>&mdash;In this second group of Epistles,
Galatians, First and Second Corinthians, and Romans, we enter upon a
period of conflict in which Christianity is being defined, and
differentiated from Judaism and Heathenism.  No great truth ever came
into the world without a battle for its right to the attention of men.
</P>

<P>
The new faith in Christ made large claims for itself.  It marked an
advance upon Judaism and maintained that in Christ was fulfilled all
the promises made by the prophets of the coming of the Jewish Messiah.
It radically antagonized the heathen religions.  It had a double task
to win men out of Judaism and heathenism.  Only by a careful study of
these great doctrinal Epistles, and the circumstances out of which they
arose, can it be seen how really great was this task.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Great Question</B> was: "On what terms does God save men?  Does He
owe salvation to any because of what they have done, or does He bestow
it as an unmerited favor upon condition of trust and self-surrender?"
Paul maintained that the sole basis of salvation is the grace of God
through Jesus Christ to be appropriated by faith on the part of man.
This is still the great question.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Jewish Faith</B> had been long in the world.  Its prophets had two
great themes, the Messiah and the Messianic Kingdom.  All Israel, while
observing feast and fast days, the precepts of the Mosaic law and
offering sacrifices, looked forward to the coming of the Messiah and
the establishment of His kingdom upon earth, as the supreme fulfillment
of its hopes.
</P>

<P>
It is the contention of Paul in these Epistles that this Messiah has
come in the person of Jesus Christ and fulfilled all the promises made
to Israel, and that, through faith in Him, believers are released from
the observance of the precepts of the Mosaic law.
</P>

<P>
There were two parties of Jews who sought to check the advance of the
early church, with its all sufficient Savior.  First, there were the
Jews who denied any and every claim of Christ to be the Messiah; of
this party were the rioters who drove Paul out of city after city and
sought to kill him in the temple.  Second, there were the Jewish
Christians who "asserted that their faith was Judaism with a new
prophet; that the law of Moses and Mosaic ceremonial practices were
binding on Christians as well as on unbelieving Jews; that Gentile
believers must first become proselytes to Judaism before they could
become Christians; and lastly that circumcision was the only gateway to
baptism."  With the first class of Jews it was not so difficult to
deal, for they were out and out antagonists, but the Jewish Christians,
(who still clung to the Jewish law) were constantly making trouble not
only amongst the Christian Jews, who had fully come out from under the
law of Moses and expressed their faith in Christ, but also among the
Christian Gentiles who had come out of the heathen religions.  The
masterly arguments of Paul, presented in Galatians and Romans, deal
chiefly with the doctrine of justification by faith in Jesus Christ
alone.  In Gal. 5:1-4 he calls the return to Jewish belief and
practice, "falling from grace."
</P>

<P>
<B>The Heathen Faith.</B>&mdash;The people of the Roman empire were idolaters.
Temples for the worship of idols occupied prominent positions in every
city.  Some of them were very beautiful, from an architectural point of
view.  But the objects of worship, frequently, were of the basest sort.
This worship caused a notorious laxness of view in regard to the
relations between the sexes.  This state of things is not overstated by
Paul in his epistle to the Romans (1:18-23).  It was this condition of
idolatrous worship which led to the decision of the Jerusalem Council
in regard to the Gentile converts (Acts 15:29).  The Christianity which
Paul taught called for a pure and upright life and a subjugation of
human passion.  We see the effects of former idolatrous lives
manifesting themselves in the evils which Paul sought to correct in his
letters to the Corinthians.  It was no small conflict in which the
Great Apostle to the Gentiles engaged when he sought to cleanse,
through Christ, the base idolatrous hearts of the men of his times.
</P>

<P>
<B>The New Faith in Christ.</B>&mdash;Paul stands for spiritual freedom in Christ
and loyalty to Him as Divine Lord without the necessity of observing
the minute regulations of the Jewish ritual.  He insists upon purity of
soul and outward life as opposed to the laxness of the idolaters.  Each
individual soul is related to Christ to whom it is responsible.
</P>

<P>
<B>Practical Bearing upon Present Day Living.</B>&mdash;The things contended for,
the evils scored in these Epistles may seem to belong to dead
controversies, but they do not.  While it is a fact that Christianity
has freed itself from Judaism and the heathen religions have been
conquered, the old evils still manifest themselves and the same
remedies must be applied to them.  Many to-day will do works of the law
(Gal. 2:16) who have no use for Christ, or His church, thinking in this
way to buy their way to God.  These are the old Judaizers come to life
again.  They often know nothing and care less for spiritual things and
heart righteousness.  Sensuality, and all its attendant evils, driven
from the old heathen temples, manifests itself in many ways; it still
seeks to array itself in beautiful garments that it may lure many to
ruin.  There is need of repeating over again the arguments of Paul for
a pure life lived in the faith of Jesus Christ, and the spiritual
upbuilding of the soul through Him.  Paul also insists upon good works
as the outcome of faith, but faith must come first.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Epistles of this Group were Written</B> on the third missionary
journey.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLE TO THE GALATIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Galatians</B> to whom this Epistle was addressed; who were they?  The
name Galatia was used in two ways.  Geographically to denote the
country inhabited by the Celtic tribes (who were descended from the
Gauls and who formerly inhabited the country we now call France).
Politically it meant the Roman province which also included "Psidia,
Lycaonia, and part of Phrygia to the south of Galatia proper."  It has
been a question which of the two Paul intended to address in his
letter.  There are no particular names of churches which are specified.
Many scholars think that Paul means to address his Epistle to the
churches of the Roman province.  In this case the letter would be sent
to the churches of a wide area, and primarily addressed to those
founded in the first missionary journey at Antioch, Iconium, Derbe, and
Lystra (Acts 14:1-28).
</P>

<P>
Luke speaks also of a region lying roundabout Derbe and Lystra where
the gospel was preached on this first journey (Acts 14:6).  The passage
in Galatians (2:5) in which Paul refers to the Jerusalem Council where
he contended for the liberty in Christ of the Gentiles would naturally
be taken to mean these first churches (however wide the application) as
the Jerusalem Council was held at the close of the first missionary
journey.  The word Galatia may be used in the narrower sense also by
Luke in speaking of the beginning of Paul's second (Acts 16:6) and
third (Acts 18:23) missionary journeys.  It would be natural for the
Judaizers, who sought to turn back the converts of Paul to Judaism, to
begin with the churches in South Galatia first.
</P>

<P>
<B>Time of Writing.</B>&mdash;The common opinion is that this epistle was written
at Ephesus, during Paul's long stay there on his third missionary
journey or between 54 and 56 A.D.  Some however would place the date
earlier.
</P>

<P>
<B>Occasion and Purpose.</B>&mdash;That which caused Paul to write this first of
his great doctrinal Epistles was the teaching of certain Judaizers who
had found their way into the churches of Galatia.  They claimed that
the Jewish law was binding upon believers in Christ, and declared that
salvation was through works of the law.  They insisted upon the rite of
circumcision.  Paul's gospel and authority were disparaged.
</P>

<P>
Paul wrote this Epistle for the purpose of showing that "faith in
Christ was the sole and sufficient condition of salvation."
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Introduction (1:1-10) Salutation.  Subject of the Epistle; the
defection of the Galatian churches.
</P>

<P>
2.  The divine commission given to Paul as an apostle (1:11-2:21).  He
makes a statement of his claims and gives a sketch of his life.  The
gospel he preached came not from man but through a revelation of Jesus
Christ.  All this is to show the authenticity of his claims.
</P>

<P>
3.  Doctrinal.  Justification is by faith (ch. 3-4).  The Galatian
churches had received the Spirit through faith and not by law; why
should they turn back?  The superiority of faith is shown by Abraham's
faith.  The covenant of the promise of Christ was before the law.  The
law is subordinate to faith, its purpose is to bring men to Christ.
There is serious danger in returning to the law.
</P>

<P>
4.  Practical.  Application of the doctrinal teaching (ch. 5-6:10).  An
exhortation to stand fast in the liberty of Christ; this liberty
excludes Judaism.  A warning against the abuse of Christian liberty.
The works of the flesh and the fruits of the Spirit.  Sowing and
reaping.
</P>

<P>
5.  Autograph conclusion (6:11-18).  Summary of the Epistle.  The glory
of the Apostle is in the cross of Christ.  Benediction.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLES TO THE CORINTHIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Church at Corinth</B> was founded during Paul's second missionary
journey (Acts 18:1-18).  When the Apostle came to Corinth he found a
home with Aquila and Priscilla and worked with them at his trade as a
tent-maker.  He preached in Corinth for over a year and a half.
Although Paul was the means of converting Crispus, the ruler of the
synagogue, and his family, he had no large success with the Jews and
consequently turned to the Gentiles.  The Gentiles gladly heard him and
there was a great ingathering into the church.
</P>

<P>
Paul's sole purpose was to preach Christ for he says, "I determined not
to know anything among you, save Jesus Christ and Him crucified" (1
Cor. 2:2).
</P>

<P>
<B>The City of Corinth</B> was the largest and most important city of
Greece.  The commerce of the world flowed through its two harbours.
The population consisted of Greeks, Jews, Italians, and a mixed
multitude; it was excitable, pleasure loving, and mercurial.  In this
city was held a perpetual vanity fair.  The vices of the east and west
met and clasped hands in the work of human degradation.  The Greek
goddess Aphrodite had a magnificent temple in which a thousand
priestesses ministered to a base worship.  While it was a center of
wealth and fashion it was a city of gilded vice.  In the philosophical
schools there was an endless discussion about words and non-essentials
and a strong tendency to set intellectual above moral distinctions.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>Occasion and Purpose.</B>-It was natural that the pressure of heathen
customs and practices should be very great upon this young church.  It
was also to be expected that parties and divisions would arise.  The
immediate cause of this Epistle was that strifes and divisions had
arisen in the church.  It was the reporting of these matters to Paul by
those "of the house of Chloe" (1 Cor. 1:11) that led him to write in
the way in which he did.  To settle the strifes of this church and to
define the relations which Christians should assume towards the
political, religious, and domestic institutions of the heathen was a
matter of no little delicacy and difficulty.  The mastery of Paul is
shown in the laying down of principles, in accordance with the gospel
of Christ, that were effective not only for the Corinthian church but
which are applicable to-day to all such church difficulties and the
conduct of Christians towards non-Christians.
</P>

<P>
<B>A Former Epistle.</B>&mdash;Previous to the one now called "The First," had
been written to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 5:9) and "it appears that the
church had replied and requested further explanation and instruction on
certain points" (5:11; 7:1; 8:1; 12:1; 16:12).
</P>

<P>
<B>Place and Time.</B>&mdash;This Epistle was written during Paul's long stay in
Ephesus (Acts 19:10; 1 Cor. 16:19) and the date is in all probability
57 A.D.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Supremacy of Christ</B> over all parties, His love as the touchstone
of all service, and His resurrection are the great subjects of this
Epistle.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Salutation and thanksgiving (1:1-9).
</P>

<P>
2.  Correction of divisions of party spirit (1:10-4:21).  It having
been reported to Paul that four parties were striving for mastery in
the church and there was great contention; he rebukes the party spirit,
sets forth the principles of his teaching, and declares that Christ
alone is the center of the Christian system.  Faith stands not in the
wisdom of men.  The only foundation is in Christ.
</P>

<P>
3.  Correction of moral disorders (ch. 5-7).  In consequence of the
close contact of the church with heathendom grave moral evils found
their way into the fold.  (a) The case of an incestuous person, Paul
writes that such a person is to be expelled because the leaven of evil
separates men from Christ.  (b) The sin of going to law in heathen
courts.  Christians ought to settle their own disputes.  (c) Sins of
the body.  No man should commit a sin as his body is the temple of the
Holy Ghost.
</P>

<P>
(d) Advice concerning marriage.  The purpose of the gospel is not to
antagonize but to Christianize the natural relations between society
and the believer.
</P>

<P>
4.  Correction of social and ecclesiastical misconceptions (ch. 8-14).
(a) The question of eating of meats offered in idol worship is decided
on the ground of love rather than knowledge.  (b) The preacher of the
gospel has the right to be supported by the church.  (c) The true
Christian liberty to be observed in the matters of eating and drinking.
The proper celebration of the Lord's Supper.  (d) The use and abuse of
spiritual gifts.
</P>

<P>
(e) The greatness of love (ch. 13) The touchstone of all is love.  (f)
The end to be sought in every spiritual gift is the edification and
upbuilding of the church.
</P>

<P>
5.  The true doctrine of the resurrection (ch. 15), Paul lays great
stress upon this doctrine.  "If Christ be not risen from the dead, then
is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain."
</P>

<P>
6.  Parting directions, exhortations, and salutations (ch. 16).
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>Occasion and Purpose.</B>&mdash;Paul was quite anxious about the reception of
his first letter by the Corinthian church.  Not long after its dispatch
he sent Titus (2 Cor. 2:13) to see how it was received and to note
whether the strife of parties had ceased, the incestuous person had
been dealt with, and other matters properly adjusted.  While Titus was
absent on this mission Paul left Ephesus on account of the riot made by
Demetrius and his fellows (Acts 19:23-41; 20:1) and went over into
Macedonia (Acts 20:1).  On the way, at Troas, he expected to meet Titus
and was greatly disappointed in not seeing him (2 Cor. 2:12-13).  It is
evident that he met Titus in Macedonia and received from him the report
of the condition of the Corinthian church and the manner in which his
first letter had been received and acted upon (2 Cor. 7:5-16).  Again
it is evident, from the Epistle, that Titus brought back the
encouraging news to the Apostle that the incestuous person had been
dealt with and had repented, and that, as a whole, the church stood
loyally by him, but still there were some who were making trouble.  It
was this report that was the occasion of the Second Epistle.  Prof. G.
B. Stevens says in regard to this letter, It reflects the mingled joy
and grief of the Apostle.  The earlier chapters are predominately
cheerful and commendatory, the latter mainly sorrowful and severe.  In
the light of these facts the letter may be described as threefold:
First, to encourage and instruct the church (1-7).  Second, to induce
the Corinthians to make a collection for the poor Judean churches
(8-9).  Third, to defend the writer's apostolic authority against the
calumnies of his enemies (10-13).
</P>

<P>
<B>Place and Time.</B>&mdash;There are a number of references by the Apostle
which show that this Epistle was written in Macedonia (1:15, 16; 2:12,
13; 8:1; 9:2) and shortly after Paul came out of Asia (1:8, compare
Acts 20:1, 2).  The time probably 57 A.D., the same year in which the
First Epistle was written.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Salutation (1:1, 2)
</P>

<P>
2.  Paul's principles and ways of working (1:3-7:16).  In these
chapters the Apostle endeavors to remove any feeling of bitterness
which may have been produced in the Corinthian church by his dealing
with a certain evil in the previous Epistle.  He also vindicates his
spiritual ministry.  He declares his love for the church and its
spiritual advancement.  He also declares that he has put off his visit
to Corinth that he might not come in sorrow.  He rejoices in the good
news brought by Titus.  While he is weak in body, the power is of God
and the ministry is a communication of the Spirit.  He asserts that he
is sustained by the hope of the future life.  He earnestly exhorts the
church to receive and live the gospel which he preached to them, for
separation from the world and unity with God.  In chapter seven he
rejoices that they have received his words so well.
</P>

<P>
3.  The collection for the poor Christians in Jerusalem (8-9).  Paul
here speaks of the liberality of the Macedonian churches and the work
of Titus who is sent to forward the contributions.
</P>

<P>
4.  Paul's vindication of his authority as an apostle (10:1-13:10).  He
has been attacked in his person, character, and teaching by parties in
the Corinthian church who would overthrow his authority and ruin the
church.  These four chapters are a magnificent setting forth of his
apostolic claims.  (a) His power and glory are not in his bodily
presence or his letters but in the spiritual might of God.  (b) His
preaching is the pure gospel of Christ.  In bodily labor, trials, and
persecutions he has excelled them all (ch. 11).  (c) He has the highest
qualifications (in visions and revelations) but he will glory only in
his infirmities.  His object is not to boast but to put an end to the
disorders in the church.  (d) The Apostle declares his intention to
visit the church.  By the power of Christ he will not spare the evil.
His desire is only for righteousness.
</P>

<P>
5.  Farewell greetings and messages (13:11-14).
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLE TO THE ROMANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Church at Rome.</B>&mdash;When and by whom this church was founded it is
not known.  It is thought that the "strangers of Rome" (Acts 2:10), who
were present at the day of Pentecost when the great manifestation of
the Holy Spirit took place, carried back the good news and that this
was the beginning of the church.  It was composed of both Jews and
Gentiles for Paul addresses both classes (Rom. 1:13; 9:24; 11:13; 2:17;
4:1; 9:13; 7:1; 9:1-5).  This church seems to have made rapid progress
(1:8).  Paul was evidently acquainted with some of the Roman Christians
(16:3-15).
</P>

<P>
<B>Occasion and Purpose.</B>&mdash;This Epistle grew out of a desire on the part
of Paul to see Rome (Acts 19:21; Rom. 1:11; 15:24-28).  As this would
be his first visit it was no more than a courteous act that he should
write to the church of this intention.  Again as the Christians in Rome
might have heard false and distorted reports of the gospel which he
preached, Paul takes care to clearly and logically set forth the
principles and doctrines which he was teaching.  This letter then
becomes very important as the summing up of the experience and teaching
of many years of service in the cause of Jesus Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>Place and Time</B>.&mdash;This Epistle was in all probability written from
Corinth during Paul's stay there in the course of his third missionary
journey 58 A.D. (compare Acts 19:21; 20:1-3; Rom. 16:23; 1 Cor. 1:14; 2
Tim. 4:20).
</P>

<P>
<B>Central Thought.</B>&mdash;The theme is justification by faith and not by
works.  There are four main positions.  First, All are guilty before
God.  Second, All need a Savior.  Third, Christ died for all.  Fourth,
We are all (through faith) one body in Him.  The thought may be put in
other ways, but all to the same purpose.  The doctrine of sin, and the
doctrine of grace; or the universality of sin and the universality of
grace.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>&mdash;There are two great sections,
Doctrinal (ch. 1-11), and Practical, (ch. 12-16).
</P>

<P>
1.  Introduction (1:1-15).  Paul's salutation to and thanksgiving for
(the faith of) the Roman church.
</P>

<P>
2.  Doctrinal (1:16-11:36).  (a) The great theme stated, Justification
by Faith.  (b) All have sinned and all are guilty, Gentiles without the
law and Jews with the law have failed to attain righteousness.  (c)
Righteousness for all comes through faith in Jesus Christ and not by
law or works; the universality of grace.  Abraham was justified by
faith (ch. 4).  The blessedness of justification by faith in Jesus
Christ (ch. 5).  (d) Objections against free grace that it will
multiply sin or discredit the law are taken up and answered.  Thorough
union with Christ on the part of the believer annihilates sin and the
law has no more any power.  The believer justified by his faith in
Christ is dead to the law while quickened to a new and holy life by the
Spirit.  (e) The apparent rejection of Israel is the problem considered
in chapters 9-11.  The nation sought righteousness through the law and
not by faith.  (f) Christ is the end of the law for righteousness.  (g)
The restoration of Israel.
</P>

<P>
3.  Practical (12-16).  (a) Advice and exhortation.  The Christian's
duty to the church and his conduct outside of it; duty to the state and
society; duty of toleration and supreme trust in Christ.  (b)
Salutations.  Paul's apology and explanation for addressing the Roman
church.  Greetings to various persons and farewell words.

THE QUESTION AT ISSUE
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Supremacy of Christ.</B>&mdash;These Epistles mark a new stage in the
writings of Paul.  The great question discussed in the second group of
Epistles was in regard to the terms of salvation.  The question now at
issue (in Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians) is: What is the nature,
the rank, the dignity of the Mediator of salvation?  Is He one of a
series of Saviors?  Does He belong to some angelic order (Col. 2:18),
or, does He stand supreme (Col. 2:8, 9, 19) and solitary?  Is He the
Head and Chief of all creation (Col. 2:19; 1:16).  Other matters are
discussed in these Epistles, but this is the great doctrinal question
and burden of the Apostle's thought.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Reason for the Raising of this Question</B> was the development of
certain false religious beliefs among which were, "asceticism, the
worship of angels, revelings in supposed visions and belief in
emanations."  These "degraded the object of faith and so destroyed its
meaning and power."
</P>

<P>
<B>The Answer to the Question.</B>&mdash;Paul is in no doubt as to the supremacy
of Christ.  All his argument is to show the Deity of Christ.  He holds
"aloft the true object of faith namely, the supreme Divine Savior
Himself, in opposition to speculation which would degrade and deny to
Him the eminence which belongs to Him" (Col. 1:15-20; Eph. 1:10, 20-23;
3-9; Philippians 2:5-11).
</P>

<P>
<B>Present Day Attention</B> has been focused upon this matter of the
supremacy of Christ.  Was he human or divine?  The arguments of Paul
still hold good for a stout belief in the Divine Christ.  The writings
of the Great Apostle are all characterized by his grasp of fundamental
things; they serve their purpose for the modern church in bringing it
back to Jesus Christ as the only Savior, as they also in times past
corrected the errors of the early church.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE WRITING OF THE EPISTLES
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Interest</B> in these Epistles is heightened by the fact that they
were written during Paul's first Roman imprisonment of which Luke gives
all too brief an account (Acts 28:30,31).  They have been called from
this fact, "The Epistles of the First Imprisonment."  It is a marvel
that Paul with his surroundings could have written in such a masterly
way and handled such lofty themes in a manner which has commanded the
attention of the thinking world ever since his day and age.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Sending of the Epistles</B>&mdash;Colossians, Philemon, and Ephesians were
evidently dispatched from Rome by the same messenger, Tychicus (Col.
4:7, 9; Eph. 6:21).  Philippians was sent by the hand of Epaphroditus
(Phil. 2:25; 4:18).
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLE TO THE COLOSSIANS
</H4>

<P>
The Church at Colossæ&mdash;The city of Colossæ was situated about 110 miles
east of Ephesus where Paul spent so long a time during his third
missionary journey (Acts 19:10).  We have no record of any visit of
Paul to this city or how the church was founded (Col. 2:1).  It is
supposed that Ephaphras might have organized this church (Col. 1:7).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Occasion</B> (and purpose) of this Epistle was evidently the coming
of Epaphras to Rome to consult Paul about the affairs of this church
(1:7, 8).
</P>

<P>
In chapter 2:8-23 we have some account of the things which were
troubling this Christian community and drawing them away from faith in
Jesus Christ as their Savior.  False teachers had appeared at Colossæ
who were confusing the minds of the Christian converts.  The starting
point of the error of teaching was the old oriental dogma that matter
is evil and the source of evil (2:8), that as God is good the world
could not have come directly from God.  To bridge the chasm between God
and the matter of the world a long chain of intermediate beings was
conceived to exist.  This doctrine played havoc with the simplest moral
conceptions for if matter is evil, and its source, then man's sin is
not in his will, but in his body.  Redemption from sin can come only
through asceticism and the mortification of the flesh.
</P>

<P>
The result of all this was a lowering of the dignity of Christ, taking
away His saving power and the "substitution of various ascetic
abstinences and ritualistic practices (2:20) for trust in Him, the
worship of angels (2:18), and a reveling in dreams and visions."  "This
was kindred to a type of speculation which later became rife under the
name of Gnosticism."
</P>

<P>
To these ideas Paul opposed the true doctrine of the Headship of Christ
(2:19) and that He is the only link between God and the universe
(1:15-17).  "By Him were all things created (1:16) that are in heaven
and that are in earth."  Christ is the only Mediator (1:13, 14).  In
this faith there is no place for ascetic mortification.  Evil is in our
unwillingness to live the life in Christ.  In Christ we are dead to sin
and risen with Him to a life of holiness (2:20-23; 3:1-4).  Christ is
not only our Redeemer (1:14) and the Head of the church, but the source
of creation and its Lord (1:16, 17).  We have a similar error (against
which Paul warns) taught to-day by the speculative thinker, who fills
the world with forces which leave no room for the working of a personal
will.
</P>

<P>
<B>Central Thought</B>&mdash;Jesus Christ the sole Savior of men and Mediator
between God and men (1:13-14), the Creator (1:16; 2:9) and Head of the
church (1:18).  Exhortation to follow Christ (3:1-4).
</P>

<P>
<B>Time and Place.</B>&mdash;This Epistle was written at Rome and sent by the
messenger, Tychicus, (4:7, 8, 18) to the church at Colossæ about 63 A.D.
</P>

<P>
Paul also directed that it be read to the church at Laodicea (4:16).
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Introduction (1:1-12) Salutation.  Thanksgiving for their faith and
prayer for their increase and knowledge of the will of God.
</P>

<P>
2.  Doctrinal.  "The sole Headship of Christ" (1:13-3:4).  (a) Christ
the Mediator.  There is redemption for us through His blood.  (b)
Christ, the image of the invisible God, Creator and Preserver of all
things.  (c) He is the Head of the church, reconciliation is only
through Him.  The Colossians were reconciled to God through the
mediation of Christ.  It is the earnest desire of Paul that the church
at Colossæ should remain rooted in the faith which it had been taught.
(d) Warning against wrong speculation; lest any man "through philosophy
or vain deceit" obscure or cause the Colossians to deny the true
Godhead of Christ (2:8-15).  (e) Renewed warnings against errors in
worship; Jewish observances, ordinances and asceticisms, and the
adoration of angels.  (f) In Christ we are dead to the rudiments of the
world and risen into communion with God in Christ.
</P>

<P>
3.  Practical (3:5-4:6).  (a) Exhortations to cast out all sins of the
unregenerate nature and to put on the new man in Christ.  Then Christ
will be all and in all.  (b) All family and social duties are to be
performed as in the sight of Christ.  (c) Renewed exhortations to
prayer and watchfulness.
</P>

<P>
4.  Conclusion (4:7-18).  (a) The mission of Tychicus and Onesimus, the
greetings of the companions of Paul and his expressed desire that the
churches of Colossæ and Laodicea exchange Epistles.  (b) The Salutation.
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLE TO PHILEMON
</H4>

<P>
<B>Occasion.</B>&mdash;This is the only purely personal letter of Paul that we
possess.  It is placed in this group because it was sent with the
Epistle to the Colossians and by the same messenger, Tychicus (Col.
4:7-9).  Philemon was a member (with his wife Apphia) of the church at
Colossæ (Philemon 2).  Onesimus was a runaway slave, belonging to
Philemon, who had found his way to Rome and been converted by Paul
(Philemon 10), who returned him, with this letter, to his master (Col.
4:9; Philemon 10-12).
</P>

<P>
In this letter we have a picture of the Apostle's kindness of heart and
a carrying out of the principles which Paul had advocated in his First
Epistle to the Corinthians (7:20-24), "Let every man abide in the same
calling wherein he was called."  We find also this same principle set
forth, in another way, in his letter to the Colossians upon the
"Supremacy of Christ."  These principles will make all men brethren in
Christ and every man will strive to serve Christ in his own place,
whatever that place is.  Paul exhorts Philemon, along this very line,
to receive Onesimus not as a servant but as a brother beloved (Philemon
16).
</P>

<P>
The practical teaching of this letter upon the relations between
masters and servants and employers and employees is very pertinent to
the present times.  The true solution of all labor troubles is that men
should regard each other as brethren under the leadership of Jesus
Christ.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Salutation and Thanksgiving (1-7).
</P>

<P>
2.  Statement of the object of the letter (8-21).  As a favor for
love's sake Philemon is asked to receive back Onesimus no longer a
runaway slave but Paul's spiritual child.  Emphasis is laid upon the
fact that he is now a Christian brother and should be received as such.
</P>

<P>
3.  Conclusion (22-25).  (a) In expectation of a speedy release from
imprisonment the Apostle asks that a lodging be secured for him (22
v.).  (b) Salutation and benediction (23-25).
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLE TO THE EPHESIANS
</H4>

<P>
<B>The City of Ephesus and the Church.</B>&mdash;This city was, next to Rome, the
most important visited by Paul.  It was the capital of Asia Minor and a
great commercial center.  It was the seat of the worship of the goddess
Diana.
</P>

<P>
Paul first visited the city when he was returning from his second
missionary tour, but, while asked to prolong his stay, he remained only
for a short time (Acts 18:19-21).  During his third missionary journey
he again visited the city and remained for three years (Acts 20:31,
compare 19:10, 22).  His success in Ephesus was very great (Acts
19:18-20, 26) and extended beyond the city.  The letters to the
churches at Colossæ (Col. 1:2) and Laodicea (this letter is lost) (Col.
4:16) show his care for the churches that were adjacent to Ephesus and
of which we have no account of his visiting.
</P>

<P>
<B>Title and Time of Writing.</B>&mdash;Many scholars think that this Epistle was
a circular letter written for the edification of the churches of Asia
Minor and sent to the church of the capital city.  This opinion is
strengthened by the lack of local allusions and the naming of friends,
as in other epistles.  The inscription "at Ephesus" is wanting in two
of the more important manuscripts.  "On this view it may be supposed
that a space was left in the salutation in which could be inserted the
name of the particular place where the letter was being read, that the
letter finally fell wholly into the keeping of the Ephesian church, and
that the space was at length permanently filled by the phrase 'at
Ephesus.'"
</P>

<P>
The time and place of writing was at Rome about 63 A.D.  This Epistle
was sent by the messenger, Tychicus, (Eph. 6:21) who also carried the
letters to the church at Colossæ and to Philemon (Col. 4:7-9).
</P>

<P>
<B>Subject.</B>&mdash;As in Colossians, the subject is the Headship of Christ
(3:9-11); His person and work.  God's eternal purpose is disclosed.
Christ is given sway over all things "both which are in heaven and
which are on earth" (1:10, 2l).  The unity of the church in Christ is
set forth; the unity of the Gentile and Jewish branches in Him; the
unity of all the individual members in Him.  This union is spiritual
and not mechanical; it is holy and pure; therefore sin is excluded.
Paul looks upon this as the mystery of the ages, now revealed to him.
There is one great kingdom, the risen and glorified Christ is the Head
of this kingdom (1:19-23).  Redemption and reception into this kingdom
is through Jesus Christ (1-7).
</P>

<P>
Paul in this epistle rises above the controversies of the hour and sees
in clear vision the eternal realities and the great plan of God for the
saving of men.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Introduction (1:1-23).  (a) Salutation.  (b) Thanksgiving and
Thesis (1:3-14).  Unity in Christ.  He who is the Head of the church is
the Center of the universe (1:10).  The eternal purpose of God in
Salvation is now made known.  Before the foundation of the world, man
and the redeemed church of Christ were in the thought of God.  Christ
in whom we have redemption looked forward to His mission from eternity.
"Creation, nature, and redemption are all parts of one system"; in the
reconciliation of the cross all orders of beings are concerned.  "That
in the dispensation of the fulness of times He might gather together in
one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on
earth; even in Him" (1:10).  (c) Prayer.  A petition that the
understanding of believers may be illuminated; that they may know the
hope of their calling and the riches of their heritage, which comes
through unity with their risen and ascended Lord.
</P>

<P>
2.  Doctrinal.  Unity in Christ (ch. 2-3).  (a) The calling of the
Gentiles out of "trespasses and sins" into a new life in Christ.  (b)
Jews and Gentiles are reconciled and brought together in one body by
the cross; "no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with
the saints, and of the household of God."  All built upon the
foundation of Jesus Christ, through the Spirit.  (c) The mystery of the
universal call was made known to Paul by a new revelation.  Prayer for
a more full comprehension of this unity.
</P>

<P>
3.  Practical.  The new life in unity with Christ (4:1-6:17).  (a)
Exhortation to walk worthy of this new life.  (b) Exhortation to gain
the victory over sin "in virtue of the sense of unity with man in
Christ."  (c) Social duties.  The regeneration and consecration in this
new life of the relations of husbands and wives, children and parents,
and slaves and masters, (d) Final entreaty, in the battle against the
powers of evil, to put "on the whole armour of God."
</P>

<P>
4.  Conclusion (6:18-24).  (a) Personal.  Paul requests special prayer
for himself in captivity.  Tychicus is commended.  (b) Farewell and
blessing.
</P>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS
</H4>

<P>
The City of Philippi and the Church.&mdash;This city is notable from the
fact that it was the first, in Europe, in which the gospel tidings were
made known.  Accounts of how Paul came to visit Macedonia and to begin
the work in Philippi are given in Acts (16:10, 12-40).  Going out of
the city as he did by the river side, where prayer was wont to be made,
and talking to a number of women about the "New Way" would not seem to
be a very favorable beginning for a movement which was to produce such
exceedingly large results.  But Paul was so full of zeal for Christ
that he seized every opportunity, no matter how small, to make Him
known.  This church afterwards was a great comfort to the Apostle.
This letter shows how he loved it and how he exhorted them to rejoice
in the Lord (4:4).
</P>

<P>
<B>Occasion.</B>&mdash;Paul was in prison in Rome.  The Philippian converts were
greatly concerned about him, therefore they sent Epaphroditus with
gifts and offerings to him (4:18).  This was not the first time that
they had taken thought of and remembered their founder, in a similar
way (4:15, 16).  The Apostle was very grateful for their care
(4:10-14).  While in Rome, Epaphroditus was taken very sick and came
near death (2:25-28).  As soon as he had recovered from his sickness
Paul sent him back to Philippi (2:28), with this letter.  The reference
to Cæsar's household shows how strong a hold Christianity was getting
in Rome (4:22; 1:12-14), and that there was great boldness in
proclaiming the gospel.
</P>

<P>
<B>Objects.</B>&mdash;It is an Epistle of thanks to the Philippians for their
kindness (4:10-18) in remembering the Apostle with substantial gifts in
his work and for their fellowship (1:5) in the gospel.
</P>

<P>
Another object is to give them friendly advices and warnings (2:12-24;
3:2-3, 17-21).  Paul does not forget, in this connection, to remind
them of Him to whom they owe a whole-hearted allegiance, their Lord and
Master, Jesus Christ (4:1).
</P>

<P>
The great doctrinal object, the Supremacy of Christ, is also set forth
as is markedly manifest in the Epistles of Colossians and Ephesians.
The whole Christian creed, "the incarnation, passion, and exaltation of
Christ" is expressed in the second chapter (2:5-11), "That at the name
of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in
earth and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess
that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."  The great
end to be attained is likeness to Christ (2:5).
</P>

<P>
<B>Time of Writing.</B>&mdash;This epistle is generally regarded as the latest of
the letters written during the first imprisonment in Rome, and in the
same year with those to the churches at Colossæ, and Ephesus.  It was
probably sent to Philippi shortly after the other Epistles (Colossians,
Philemon, and Ephesians) had been dispatched to Asia Minor.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>&mdash;This epistle is divided into
two parts.
</P>

<P>
First part (1:1-3:1).
</P>

<P>
I.  Introduction (1:1-2:4).  (a) Greeting.  (b) Paul's thanksgiving,
joy in the fellowship, and prayer for the Philippians.  (c) An account
of the rapid spread of the gospel in Rome and the apostle's rejoicing
that Christ is preached.  (d) Exhortation to unity in Christ.
</P>

<P>
2.  Doctrinal (2:5-12).  In this short passage we have the Christian
creed in brief form.  "The Godhead of Christ and His Manhood&mdash;His
Pre-existence and His Incarnation&mdash;His Passion and His Exaltation."
</P>

<P>
3.  Conclusion of the first part (2:13-3:1).  (a) Renewed exhortation
to an upright and blameless Christian life.  (b) The return of
Epaphroditus.  (c) Farewell message.
</P>

<P>
Second part (3:2-4:23).  This section seems to have been added after
the letter had been finished.
</P>

<P>
1.  Warnings (3:2-21).  (a) Against Judaic errors.  Paul could boast
that he had been a good Jew and scrupulously kept the law, yet he
renounced all that he might win Christ.  True righteousness can come
only through faith in Christ.  (b) Against a false idea of the liberty
of the gospel; whereby men, claiming to be Christians, walked in evil
ways.
</P>

<P>
2.  Final exhortations (4:1-9) to steadfastness, unity, joy, and the
following of all good in Christ.  Acknowledgment of gifts and
benedictions (4:10-23).

THE PLACE OF THE EPISTLES
</H4>

<P>
<B>When Written.</B>&mdash;It is generally agreed among scholars that no place
can be found for the writing of First Timothy, Titus, and Second
Timothy in the period covered by Luke in his narrative in Acts.
</P>

<P>
Agreeing with the tradition of the church, however, the opinion of many
eminent scholars is that Paul was released from the first Roman
imprisonment (Acts 28:16, 30), that he again took up his missionary
work, and at the end of a few years of such work, he was a second time
imprisoned and suffered martyrdom under the Roman Emperor Nero.
</P>

<P>
It was during this period between the first and second imprisonments
that First Timothy and Titus were written.  Second Timothy was written
during the second imprisonment at Rome, and at the time when Paul was
expecting his sentence of death.  Eusebius (H. E. 2:22-2) says, that
"at the end of the two years of imprisonment, according to tradition,
Paul went forth again upon the ministry of preaching; and in a second
visit to the city ended his life by martyrdom under Nero, and that
during his imprisonment he wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy."
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
PAUL'S FOURTH MISSIONARY JOURNEY
</H4>

<P>
<B>Notices and Time.</B>&mdash;From the notices given in the Epistles and other
sources the probable course of the missionary travels of Paul from
63-67 A.D. has been reconstructed.
</P>

<P>
<B>The First Trip Eastward.</B>&mdash;When Paul wrote to the church at Philippi
(2:24) and to Philemon at Colossæ (22 v.) he evidently expected to be
released from his imprisonment very soon and to see his beloved
Philippian church and Philemon.  He was so sure of speedily visiting
Colossæ that he asked that a lodging be prepared for him.  With Paul to
plan was to act and it is quite possible that he undertook this trip
immediately upon his release from prison.  He probably also visited
Ephesus and a number of other cities.

<P>
<B>The Trip Westward to Spain.</B>&mdash;In the Epistle to the Romans Paul
declared his intention to visit Spain (Rom. 15:24, 28).  It is probable
that he, upon his return from the visit to Asia Minor, remained for a
very short time in Rome and then made a voyage to Spain.
</P>

<P>
The tradition of the early church is very pronounced upon this voyage
to Spain.  Clement of Rome (Cor. 5) speaks of Paul "having reached the
furtherest bound of the west."  This could hardly mean anything but
Spain.  The Muratorian Fragment names "the departure of Paul from the
city to Spain."
</P>

<P>
<B>The Second Trip Eastward.</B>&mdash;We can now, from notices in First and
Second Timothy and Titus, quite closely follow Paul in his travels.
From Spain he probably went by various stages to Ephesus, where as he
tells us (1 Tim. 1:3) he left Timothy in charge when he went into
Macedonia.  From Macedonia he probably wrote his first letter to
Timothy (1:3).  From Macedonia he went to Troas and from Troas to
Miletus (2 Tim. 4:13).  On account of sickness Trophimus was left at
Miletus (2 Tim. 4:20).  He next probably visited Crete, where he left
Titus (Titus 1:5).  From Crete it is thought that Paul went to Corinth
(2 Tim. 4:20) where he left Erastus and in all probability wrote to
Titus (1:5).  In the letter to Titus Paul speaks of being at Nicopolis
and of his intention to spend the winter in that city (Titus 3:12).
But these notices of places are by no means exhaustive.  They show,
however, how wide were Paul's last travels.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Second Imprisonment of Paul.</B>&mdash;It is by no means unlikely that the
enemies of Paul, of whom we hear so much in the first three missionary
journeys, were stirred to renewed activity by again seeing him at
liberty and conducting an active missionary campaign.  But with a
prisoner on parole from the Imperial Court the local magistrates could
do nothing.  But a new element came in.  The great fire, which
destroyed so large a part of the city of Rome on the 18th of July, 64
A.D., was used by the Emperor Nero as an excuse for starting a great
persecution against the Christians.  This was done to divert the odium
of the starting of the fire from himself, for he had sung and danced
the "Mime of the Burning of Troy" from a turret of his palace during
this great conflagration.  It was some time before this persecution was
extended to the provinces and Paul's enemies saw their opportunity to
accuse him to the Imperial Court, where under the circumstances they
would then find a ready hearing.  Paul was probably rearrested at
Nicopolis where he intended to winter (Titus 3:12) and hurried off to
Rome.  This time he endured no light imprisonment.  Onesiphorus had
difficulty in finding him (2 Tim. 1:16, 17) and he was closely confined
in a common criminal dungeon (2 Tim. 2:9).  From this dungeon he wrote
the Second Epistle to Timothy and from thence he went to his death.

THE QUESTIONS DISCUSSED
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Personal Element</B> in these epistles is quite large both in respect
to Timothy and Titus and Paul himself, but it is quite evident that
this element is not the chief cause for the writing.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Doctrinal Part.</B>&mdash;Paul is here as strenuous for the need of
repentance, the atonement through Jesus Christ and His sole sufficiency
as Mediator, Savior, and Lord of all (1 Tim. 1:15-17; Titus 2:13;
3:4-7), as in his other Epistles.  There are also enemies of the truth
who are to be opposed (2 Tim. 3).  It is quite evident from what Paul
says in the second chapter and elsewhere in Titus and Second Timothy
that the Colossian heresy is already bearing its evil fruit and is
likely in the future to do great injury to the churches.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Practical Teaching</B> about the necessity of developing and
conserving the Church's system of government occupies, however, the
chief place.  "The two notes which are struck again and again are:
First, 'Hold fast the tradition, the deposit of faith.'  Second,
'Preserve order in the church.'  In short this group of Epistles
constitutes Paul's last will and testament in which he gives his final
instructions for the maintenance and continuity of the faith."
</P>

<P>
The church of Jesus Christ must have form and order.  The truth must
have a proper shelter.  Churches must have and observe certain
regulations.  There must be proper officers.
</P>

<P>
The gospel is applied to outward conduct.  Great stress is laid upon
the character of church officers (1 Tim. 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-7).  Pastors
are directed how they should bear themselves toward church members and
what they should teach (1 Tim. 5; Titus 2).  The conduct of the Church
in the presence of the heathen world and its magistrates is set forth
(Titus 3).  Instruction is given in regard to public worship (1 Tim.
2).  The most effective barrier against all forms of evil, it is
declared, is a diligent study of the Scriptures and a fervent preaching
of the word (2 Tim. 3:13-4:5).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Special Theme</B> then is, "The constitution, methods, and conduct of
the early churches."  (1 Tim. 2:1, 2, 8, 9-12; 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-14;
2:1-10; 3:1, 2, 8-11, 13, 14; 2 Tim. 2:2, 14-18; 3:6-9).

<H4 ALIGN="center">
PAUL'S LAST DECLARATION OF HIS FAITH
</H4>

<P>
The famous passage in 2 Timothy (4:6-8) shows how the Great Apostle
went triumphantly to his death.  It is a declaration of the sustaining
power of his faith in the Savior whom he had everywhere proclaimed.
</P>

<P>
"I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand.
I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day; and not
to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing."
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY
</H4>

<P>
<B>Timothy</B> was one of the close companions of Paul.  His father was a
Greek and his mother a Jewess, by the name of Eunice, (2 Tim. 1:5; Acts
16:1).  He was a native of Lystra, Paul took him as his companion in
travel and addressed two Epistles to him; he was sent on a number of
important missions.  Timothy is mentioned twenty-four times by name in
the Acts and Epistles; from these notices we can construct his
itinerary with Paul and see how beloved and how trusted he was by the
Great Apostle.  During Paul's last journey he left him in charge of the
affairs of the church at Ephesus (1 Tim. 1:3).  When Paul was
apprehended a second time and lying in a dungeon at Rome, in
expectation of death, he wrote Timothy the last letter (2 Timothy) he
ever penned, and besought him to come to him as speedily as possible (2
Tim. 4:9).
</P>

<P>
<B>Time and Place of Writing.</B>&mdash;Paul in all probability wrote the First
Epistle to Timothy from Macedonia (1 Tim. 1:3) in the year 66 A.D.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Purpose</B> "involved is through the instruction and exhortation of
Timothy, to purify, strengthen, and elevate the Christian life of the
church in Ephesus."  This teaching is put in such a way that it is
applicable to every Christian minister and church.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Greeting (1:1, 2).
</P>

<P>
2.  The True teaching of the gospel (ch. 1).  Timothy is warned against
false teachers and reminded of the aim and end of life in Christ.
</P>

<P>
3.  The order and regulation of public worship (ch. 2).  (a) Prayer,
for those in authority and for all men.  (b) Instruction.  There is one
God and one Mediator (Christ) between God and man.  (c) Conduct of men
and women in the church assemblies.
</P>

<P>
4.  Qualifications of the church officers (ch. 3).  (a) The ideal
minister.  (b) The ideal deacon and the ministering women.  (c)
Conclusion of chapter.  Paul declares his intention to visit Timothy.
An ascription of praise.
</P>

<P>
5.  The government of the Christian church and community (ch. 4-6).  In
these three chapters Timothy is charged by Paul to keep before him a
high view of the church and its grand destiny.  (a) Timothy, as a
teacher, is reminded of his commission to put the church on guard
against errors of doctrine and life (ch. 4).  (b) Timothy is shown how
he should bear rule and conduct himself towards the elders and women of
his congregation.  Paul adds instructions in regard to a man's care for
his family, support of the ministry, discipline of offenders, etc. (ch.
5).  (c) Relations of masters and servants.  Right attitude of
believers in Christ toward riches.  The chief thing is to follow after
righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness, and to fight
the good fight of faith (6:1-19).  (d) Closing charge to Timothy with
benediction (6:20, 21).
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE EPISTLE TO TITUS
</H4>

<P>
<B>Titus</B> was a beloved disciple of Paul.  He was a Gentile and was taken
by Paul to Jerusalem and was made a test case of the freedom of the
gospel and was not compelled to be circumcised (Gal. 2:1-5).  He is
mentioned by name, by Paul, twelve times in four of the Epistles (2
Cor. 2:13; 7:6, 13, 14; 8:6, 16, 23; 12:18; Gal. 2:1, 3; 2 Tim. 4:10;
Titus 1:4).  The early church tradition is that Titus was descended
from the royal family of Crete.  He was an able and capable missionary.
We have no account of his conversion.  He might have come first in
contact with Paul and been converted when the Great Apostle visited
Crete on his way to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27:7-13).  Some time was
spent at this island by Paul's company (Acts 27:9).  Paul again visited
Crete after his first Roman imprisonment and when he went away he left
Titus in charge of affairs (Titus 1:5), "To set in order things that
are wanting and to ordain elders in every city."  This message of Paul
to Titus not only shows the confidence which Paul reposed in him, but
also how widespread Christianity was in Crete.  After Titus had
completed his special work in Crete he was to rejoin Paul at Nicopolis
(Titus 3:12).
</P>

<P>
<B>The Purpose</B> of this letter is to show Titus what he is to do, in his
work with the churches, and how to do it.
</P>

<P>
<B>Time and Place of Writing.</B>&mdash;It is thought that this Epistle was
written from Corinth in 66 A.D.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Greeting and subject of the Epistle (1:1-5).  Titus is left in
Crete to accomplish certain things (1:5) after which he is to rejoin
Paul (3:12).
</P>

<P>
2.  The kind of officers to be appointed in the Cretan churches
(1:5-16).  Special moral and spiritual fitness is set forth as
necessary in view of the peculiar character of the Cretans and certain
forms of doctrinal error.
</P>

<P>
3.  The instruction to be given to the Cretans (2:1-3:11).  (a) "The
things which become sound doctrine."  (b) Practical teaching for the
proper regulation of the conduct of all classes.  (c) The foundation of
the instruction rests upon Christ.  (d) Proper attitude of the
Christian community toward the Pagan world; magistrates and those who
have not yet believed in Christ.  Kindness and gentleness and the
avoidance of foolish questions best reveal the spirit of Christ by
those who profess His name.  (e) Parting requests and benediction
(3:12-15).
</P>

<BR>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY
</H4>

<P>
<B>The Last Words of Paul.</B>&mdash;This Epistle is of special interest as it
contains the last recorded words of Paul to his faithful disciple,
Timothy.  The Great Apostle is writing from a strict prison confinement
(1:16, 17; 2:9).  He has had a first preliminary trial (4:16) and this
was of such a dread nature that none of his friends dare to stand with
him, yet he rejoices in his Lord that He stood by him and strengthened
him.  He feels however that his end is near and gives a magnificent
testimony of his faith (4:6-8).  He urges Timothy to come to him in
Rome and bring Mark with him (4:9, 11).
</P>

<P>
<B>Time and Place of Writing.</B>&mdash;It was written by Paul in prison at Rome
67 A.D.
</P>

<P>
<B>The Purpose.</B>&mdash;Paul shows here his care for the churches, their
upbuilding in the faith and their proper regulation of the things that
pertain to worship and organization.  Timothy, as a preacher of the
Word, has his personal responsibility, for the upbuilding of the
churches, presented to him.
</P>

<P>
<B>Principal Divisions and Chief Points.</B>
</P>

<P>
1.  Greeting and thanksgiving (1:1-5).
</P>

<P>
2.  The Christian conduct of Timothy (1:6-2:14).  Paul exhorts Timothy
not to allow himself to be daunted by fear of opposition or suffering
in doing his work for Christ.  He encourages him by, (a) The great
revelation and power of the gospel.  (b) His own work.  (c) The sure
hope of a great reward.
</P>

<P>
3.  Timothy as a preacher of the Word (2:15-4:5).  Paul exhorts
Timothy, (a) To study to show himself a workman.  (b) In the perilous
times that are coming to feed on the Word of God and preach it in
season and out of season.
</P>

<P>
4.  Last words of Paul (4:6-22).  The Apostle now turns to himself and
speaks of his coming martyrdom.  He is ready to be offered, he has
fought a good fight.  He beseeches Timothy to come and see him and
bring Mark.  He refers to his first hearing when every friend left him
alone and only the Lord stood by him.  He, after various messages,
closes with the usual benediction.
